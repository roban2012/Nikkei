Executive summary<br><br>
Germany has one of the most competitive manufacturing
industries in the world and is a global leader in
the manufacturing equipment sector. This is in no
small measure due to Germany’s specialisation in research,
development and production of innovative
manufacturing technologies and the management of
complex industrial processes. Germany’s strong machinery
and plant manufacturing industry, its globally
significant level of IT competences and its know-how
in embedded systems and automation engineering
mean that it is extremely well placed to develop its
position as a leader in the manufacturing engineering
industry. Germany is thus uniquely positioned to tap
into the potential of a new type of industrialisation:
Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
The first three industrial revolutions came about as a
result of mechanisation, electricity and IT. Now, the introduction
of the Internet of Things and Services into
the manufacturing environment is ushering in a fourth
industrial revolution. In the future, businesses will establish
global networks that incorporate their machinery,
warehousing systems and production facilities in
the shape of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In the
manufacturing environment, these Cyber-Physical
Systems comprise smart machines, storage systems
and production facilities capable of autonomously exchanging
information, triggering actions and controlling
each other independently. This facilitates fundamental
improvements to the industrial processes
involved in manufacturing, engineering, material usage
and supply chain and life cycle management. The
smart factories that are already beginning to appear
employ a completely new approach to production.
Smart products are uniquely identifiable, may be located
at all times and know their own history, current
status and alternative routes to achieving their target
state. The embedded manufacturing systems are vertically
networked with business processes within factories
and enterprises and horizontally connected to
dispersed value networks that can be managed in real
time C from the moment an order is placed right
through to outbound logistics. In addition, they both

enable and require end-to-end engineering across the
entire value chain.<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 holds huge potential. Smart factories allow
individual customer requirements to be met and mean
that even one-off items can be manufactured profitably.<br><br>
In Industrie 4.0, dynamic business and engineering
processes enable last-minute changes to production
and deliver the ability to respond flexibly to disruptions
and failures on behalf of suppliers, for example. End-toend
transparency is provided over the manufacturing
process, facilitating optimised decision-making. Industrie
4.0 will also result in new ways of creating value
and novel business models. In particular, it will provide
start-ups and small businesses with the opportunity
to develop and provide downstream services.<br><br>
In addition, Industrie 4.0 will address and solve some
of the challenges facing the world today such as
resource and energy efficiency, urban production and
demographic change. Industrie 4.0 enables continuous
resource productivity and efficiency gains to be
delivered across the entire value network. It allows
work to be organised in a way that takes demographic
change and social factors into account. Smart assistance
systems release workers from having to perform
routine tasks, enabling them to focus on creative,
value-added activities. In view of the impending shortage
of skilled workers, this will allow older workers to
extend their working lives and remain productive for
longer. Flexible work organisation will enable workers
to combine their work, private lives and continuing
professional development more effectively, promoting
a better work-life balance.<br><br>
Global competition in the manufacturing engineering
sector is becoming fiercer and fiercer and Germany is
not the only country to have recognised the trend to deploy
the Internet of Things and Services in manufacturing
industry. Moreover, it is not just competitors in Asia that
pose a threat to German industry C the US is also taking
measures to combat deindustrialisation through programmes
to promote “advanced manufacturing”.<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>

In order to bring about the shift from industrial production
to Industrie 4.0, Germany needs to adopt a dual
strategy. Germany’s manufacturing equipment industry
should seek to maintain its global market leadership
by consistently integrating information and communication
technology into its traditional high-tech strategies
so that it can become the leading supplier of smart
manufacturing technologies. At the same time, it will be
necessary to create and serve new leading markets for
CPS technologies and products. In order to deliver the
goals of this dual CPS strategy, the following features
of Industrie 4.0 should be implemented:<br><br>
--Horizontal integration through value networks<br><br>
--End-to-end digital integration of engineering
across the entire value chain<br><br>
--Vertical integration and networked manufacturing
systems<br><br>
The journey towards Industrie 4.0 will require Germany
to put a huge amount of effort into research and development.<br><br>
In order to implement the dual strategy, research
is required into the horizontal and vertical integration
of manufacturing systems and end-to-end
integration of engineering. In addition, attention should
be paid to the new social infrastructures in the workplace
that will come about as a result of Industrie 4.0
systems, as well as the continued development of CPS
technologies.<br><br>
If Industrie 4.0 is to be successfully implemented, research
and development activities will need to be accompanied
by the appropriate industrial and industrial
policy decisions. The Industrie 4.0 Working Group believes
that action is needed in the following eight key
areas:<br><br>

-- Standardisation and reference architecture:<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 will involve networking and integration
of several different companies through value
networks. This collaborative partnership will only be
possible if a single set of common standards is
developed. A reference architecture will be needed
to provide a technical description of these standards
and facilitate their implementation.<br><br>

--  Managing complex systems: Products and
manufacturing systems are becoming more and
more complex. Appropriate planning and explanatory
models can provide a basis for managing this
growing complexity. Engineers should therefore be
equipped with the methods and tools required to
develop such models.<br><br>
--  A comprehensive broadband infrastructure for
industry: Reliable, comprehensive and high-quality
communication networks are a key requirement for
Industrie 4.0. Broadband Internet infrastructure
therefore needs to be expanded on a massive
scale, both within Germany and between Germany
and its partner countries.<br><br>
--  Safety and security: Safety and security are both
critical to the success of smart manufacturing
systems. It is important to ensure that production
facilities and the products themselves do not pose
a danger either to people or to the environment. At
the same time, both production facilities and
products and in particular the data and information
they contain C need to be protected against
misuse and unauthorised access. This will require,
for example, the deployment of integrated safety
and security architectures and unique identifiers,
together with the relevant enhancements to
training and continuing professional development
content.<br><br>
--  Work organisation and design: In smart factories,
the role of employees will change significantly.
Increasingly real-time oriented control will transform
work content, work processes and the working
environment. Implementation of a socio-technical
approach to work organisation will offer workers the
opportunity to enjoy greater responsibility and
enhance their personal development. For this to be
possible, it will be necessary to deploy participative
work design and lifelong learning measures and to
launch model reference projects.<br><br>
--  Training and continuing professional development:
Industrie 4.0 will radically transform workers’
job and competence profiles. It will therefore be
necessary to implement appropriate training
strategies and to organise work in a way that
fosters learning, enabling lifelong learning and workplace-based CPD. In order to achieve this,
model projects and “best practice networks” should
be promoted and digital learning techniques should
be investigated.<br><br>
--  Regulatory framework: Whilst the new manufacturing
processes and horizontal business networks
found in Industrie 4.0 will need to comply with the
law, existing legislation will also need to be
adapted to take account of new innovations. The
challenges include the protection of corporate
data, liability issues, handling of personal data and
trade restrictions. This will require not only legislation
but also other types of action on behalf of
businesses C an extensive range of suitable
instruments exists, including guidelines, model
contracts and company agreements or self-regulation
initiatives such as audits.<br><br>

--  Resource efficiency: Quite apart from the high
costs, manufacturing industry’s consumption of
large amounts of raw materials and energy also
poses a number of threats to the environment and
security of supply. Industrie 4.0 will deliver gains in
resource productivity and efficiency. It will be
necessary to calculate the trade-offs between the
additional resources that will need to be invested in
smart factories and the potential savings generated.<br><br>
The journey towards Industrie 4.0 will be an evolutionary
process. Current basic technologies and experience
will have to be adapted to the specific requirements
of manufacturing engineering and innovative
solutions for new locations and new markets will have
to be explored. If this is done successfully, Industrie 4.0
will allow Germany to increase its global competitiveness
and preserve its domestic manufacturing industry.<br><br>

<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>

Securing the future of German manufacturing industry
Germany has one of the most competitive manufacturing
industries in the world. This is due to its ability to
manage complex industrial processes where different
tasks are performed by different partners in different
geographical locations. It has been successfully employing
information and communication technology
(ICT) to do this for several decades C today, approximately
90 percent of all industrial manufacturing processes
are already supported by ICT. Over the past 30
years or so, the IT revolution has brought about a radical
transformation of the world in which we live and work,
with an impact comparable to that of mechanisation and
electricity in the first and second Industrial Revolutions.1
The evolution of PCs into smart devices has been accompanied
by a trend for more and more IT infrastructure
and services to be provided through smart networks
(cloud computing). In conjunction with ever
greater miniaturisation and the unstoppable march of
the Internet, this trend is ushering in a world where
ubiquitous computing is becoming a reality.<br><br>

Powerful, autonomous microcomputers (embedded
systems) are increasingly being wirelessly networked
with each other and with the Internet. This is resulting in
the convergence of the physical world and the virtual
world (cyberspace) in the form of Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS). Following the introduction of the new Internet
protocol IPv62 in 2012, there are now sufficient
addresses available to enable universal direct networking
of smart objects via the Internet.<br><br>
This means that for the first time ever it is now possible
to network resources, information, objects and people
to create the Internet of Things and Services. The effects
of this phenomenon will also be felt by industry.
In the realm of manufacturing, this technological evolution
can be described as the fourth stage of industrialisation,
or Industrie 4.03 (Fig. 1).<br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">Figure 1: The four stages of the Industrial Revolution</a><br><br>


Industrialisation began with the introduction of mechanical
manufacturing equipment at the end of the
18th century, when machines like the mechanical loom
revolutionised the way goods were made. This first industrial
revolution was followed by a second one that began around the turn of the 20th century and involved
electrically-powered mass production of goods based
on the division of labour. This was in turn superseded
by the third industrial revolution that started during the
early 1970s and has continued right up to the present
day. This third revolution employed electronics and information
technology (IT) to achieve increased automation
of manufacturing processes, as machines took
over not only a substantial proportion of the “manual
labour” but also some of the “brainwork”.<br><br>
Germany needs to draw on its strengths as the world’s
leading manufacturing equipment supplier and in the
field of embedded systems by harnessing the spread
of the Internet of Things and Services into the manufacturing
environment so that it can lead the way towards
the fourth stage of industrialisation.<br><br>
Rolling out Industrie 4.0 will not only strengthen Germany’s
competitive position but also drive solutions to
both global challenges (e.g. resource and energy efficiency)
and national challenges (e.g. managing demographic
change). However, it is crucial to consider
technological innovations within their sociocultural
context4, since cultural and social changes are also
major drivers of innovation in their own right. Demographic
change, for example, has the potential to
transform all the key areas of our society, such as the
way that learning is organised, the nature of work and
health as people live longer lives and the infrastructure
of local communities. This will in turn have significant
implications for Germany’s productivity. By optimising
the relationship between technological and
social innovation processes, we will be making an important
contribution to the competitiveness and productivity
of the German economy.5<br><br>

Using the Internet of Things and Services
in manufacturing<br><br>
The Internet of Things and Services makes it possible
to create networks incorporating the entire manufacturing
process that convert factories into a smart environment.
Cyber-Physical Production Systems comprise
smart machines, warehousing systems and production
facilities that have been developed digitally and feature
end-to-end ICT-based integration, from inbound logistics
to production, marketing, outbound logistics and
service. This not only allows production to be configured
more flexibly but also taps into the opportunities
offered by much more differentiated management and
control processes.<br><br>
In addition to optimising existing IT-based processes,
Industrie 4.0 will therefore also unlock the potential of
even more differentiated tracking of both detailed processes
and overall effects at a global scale6 which it
was previously impossible to record. It will also involve
closer cooperation between business partners (e.g.
suppliers and customers) and between employees,
providing new opportunities for mutual benefit.7
As the world’s leading manufacturing equipment supplier,
Germany is uniquely well placed to tap into the
potential of this new form of industrialisation.8 Germany’s
global market leaders include numerous “hidden
champions” who provide specialised solutions C 22 of
Germany’s top 100 small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) are machinery and plant manufacturers, with
three of them featuring in the top ten.9 Indeed, many
leading figures in the machinery and plant manufacturing
industry consider their main competitors to be domestic
ones.10 Machinery and plant also rank as one of
Germany’s main exports alongside cars and chemicals.
11 Moreover, German machinery and plant manufacturers
expect to maintain their leadership position in the future. 60% of them believe that their technological
competitive advantage will increase over the next five
years, while just under 40% hope to maintain their current
position.12 Nonetheless, global competition in the
manufacturing engineering sector is becoming fiercer
and fiercer. And it is not just competitors in Asia that
pose a threat to German industry C the US is also taking
measures to combat deindustrialisation through
programmes to promote “advanced manufacturing”.<br><br>
Furthermore, manufacturing is becoming more dynamic
and complex all the time. For example, advances in laser
sintering technology mean that it is now possible to
“print” complex 3D structures to a high quality standard
within a matter of hours. This is resulting in the emergence
of completely new business models and services
where the end customer is much more closely involved
C customers can create their own designs and
e-mail them to a “copyshop”, or they can have objects
scanned and “copied”. <br><br>

On the initiative of the Industry-Science Research Alliance,
the partners in the Industrie 4.0 Platform have
therefore set themselves the goal of implementing the
German government’s strategic initiative to secure the
competitiveness of German industry.13<br><br>

The Internet of Things and Services is coming to the manufacturing environment:
In essence, Industrie 4.0 will involve the technical integration of CPS into manufacturing and logistics and
the use of the Internet of Things and Services in industrial processes. This will have implications for value
creation, business models, downstream services and work organisation.
<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 offers Germany the
chance to further strengthen its
position as a manufacturing location,
manufacturing equipment
supplier and IT business solutions
supplier. It is encouraging to see
that all the stakeholders in Germany
are now working closely
together through the Industrie 4.0
Platform in order to move ahead
with implementation.  <br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T3">Industrie 4.0 potential</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Industrie 4.0 initiative has huge potential:<br><br>
--  Meeting individual customer requirements
Industrie 4.0 allows individual, customer-specific
criteria to be included in the design, configuration,
ordering, planning, manufacture and operation
phases and enables last-minute changes to be
incorporated. In Industrie 4.0 it is possible to
manufacture one-off items and have very low
production volumes (batch size of 1) whilst still
making a profit.<br><br>

--  Flexibility<br><br>
CPS-based ad hoc networking enables dynamic
configuration of different aspects of business
processes, such as quality, time, risk, robustness,
price and eco-friendliness. This facilitates continuous
“trimming” of materials and supply chains. It also
means that engineering processes can be made
more agile, manufacturing processes can be
changed, temporary shortages (e.g. due to supply
issues) can be compensated for and huge increases
in output can be achieved in a short space of time.<br><br>
--  Optimised decision-taking<br><br>
In order to succeed in a global market, it is becoming
critical to be able to take the right decisions,
often at very short notice. Industrie 4.0 provides
end-to-end transparency in real time, allowing early
verification of design decisions in the sphere of
engineering and both more flexible responses to
disruption and global optimisation across all of a
company’s sites in the sphere of production.<br><br>
--  Resource productivity and efficiency<br><br>
The overarching strategic goals for industrial
manufacturing processes still apply to Industrie 4.0:
delivering the highest possible output of products
from a given volume of resources (resource productivity)
and using the lowest possible amount of
resources to deliver a particular output (resource
efficiency). CPS allows manufacturing processes to
be optimised on a case-by-case basis across the
entire value network. Moreover, rather than having
to stop production, systems can be continuously
optimised during production in terms of their
resource and energy consumption or reducing their
emissions.14<br><br>
--  Creating value opportunities through new
services<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 opens up new ways of creating value
and new forms of employment, for example
through downstream services. Smart algorithms
can be applied to the large quantities of diverse
data (big data) recorded by smart devices in order
to provide innovative services. There are particularly
significant opportunities for SMEs and
startups to develop B2B (business-to-business)
services for Industrie 4.0.<br><br>

--  Responding to demographic change in the
workplace<br><br>
In conjunction with work organisation and competency
development initiatives, interactive collaboration
between human beings and technological
systems will provide businesses with new ways of
turning demographic change to their advantage. In
the face of the shortage of skilled labour and the
growing diversity of the workforce (in terms of age,
gender and cultural background), Industrie 4.0 will
enable diverse and flexible career paths that will
allow people to keep working and remain productive
for longer.<br><br>
--  Work-Life-Balance<br><br>
The more flexible work organisation models of
companies that use CPS mean that they are well
placed to meet the growing need of employees to
strike a better balance between their work and their
private lives and also between personal development
and continuing professional development.<br><br>
Smart assistance systems, for example, will provide
new opportunities to organise work in a way that
delivers a new standard of flexibility to meet
companies’ requirements and the personal needs
of employees. As the size of the workforce declines,
this will give CPS companies a clear advantage
when it comes to recruiting the best employees.
--  A high-wage economy that is still competitive
Industrie 4.0’s dual strategy will allow Germany to
develop its position as a leading supplier and also
become the leading market for Industrie 4.0
solutions.<br><br>
However, Industrie 4.0 will not pose an exclusively
technological or IT-related challenge to the relevant industries.<br><br>
The changing technology will also have farreaching
organisational implications, providing an opportunity
to develop new business and corporate
models and facilitating greater employee engagement.
Germany successfully implemented the third Industrial
Revolution (“Industrie 3.0”) during the early 1980s by
delivering more flexible automated manufacturing
through the integration of Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) into manufacturing technology whilst at
the same time managing the impact on the workforce through an approach based on social partnership. Its
strong industrial base, successful software industry
and know-how in the field of semantic technologies15
mean that Germany is extremely well-placed to implement
Industrie 4.0. It should be possible to overcome
the current obstacles, such as technology acceptance
issues or the limited pool of skilled workers on the labour
market. However, it will only be possible to secure
the future of German industry if all the relevant stakeholders
work together to unlock the potential offered by
the Internet of Things and Services for manufacturing
industry.<br><br>
Since 2006, the German government has been promoting
the Internet of Things and Services16 under its
High-Tech Strategy. Several technology programmes have also been successfully launched. The Industry-
Science Research Alliance is now progressing this initiative
at a cross-sectoral level through the Industrie 4.0
project. The establishment of the Industrie 4.0 Platform
with a Secretariat provided jointly by the professional
associations BITKOM, VDMA and ZVEI was the logical
next step in its implementation. The next task will be to
produce R&D roadmaps for the key priority themes.<br><br>
Securing the future of German manufacturing industry
C this is the goal that the partners in the Industrie
4.0 Platform have set themselves. The Platform invites
all the relevant stakeholders to continue exploring
the opportunities provided by Industrie 4.0 so that together
we can help to ensure successful implementation
of its revolutionary vision.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
2 The vision: Industrie 4.0 as part of a smart, networked world
In a “smart, networked world”, the Internet of Things
and Services will make its presence felt in all of the key
areas.1 This transformation is leading to the emergence
of smart grids in the field of energy supply, sustainable
mobility strategies (smart mobility, smart logistics) and
smart health in the realm of healthcare. In the manufacturing
environment, vertical networking, end-to-end engineering
and horizontal integration across the entire
value network of increasingly smart products and systems
is set to usher in the fourth stage of industrialisation
C “Industrie 4.0”.<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 is focused on creating smart products,
procedures and processes. Smart factories constitute
a key feature of Industrie 4.0. Smart factories are capable
of managing complexity, are less prone to disruption
and are able to manufacture goods more efficiently.<br><br>
In the smart factory, human beings, machines and resources
communicate with each other as naturally as in
a social network. Smart products know the details of
how they were manufactured and how they are intended
to be used. They actively support the manufacturing
process, answering questions such as “when was I
made?”, “which parameters should be used to process me?”, “where should I be delivered to?”, etc. Its interfaces
with smart mobility, smart logistics and smart
grids will make the smart factory a key component of
tomorrow’s smart infrastructures. This will result in the
transformation of conventional value chains and the
emergence of new business models.2<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 should therefore not be approached in
isolation but should be seen as one of a number of key
areas where action is needed. Consequently, Industrie
4.0 should be implemented in an interdisciplinary manner
and in close cooperation with the other key areas
(see Fig. 2).<br><br>

<a href= "pic09.html">Figure 2: Industry 4.0 and smart factories as part of the Internet of Things and Services</a><br><br>
2.1 Shaping the vision of Industrie 4.0
Achieving the paradigm shift required to deliver Industrie
4.0 is a long-term project and will involve a gradual
process. Throughout this process, it will be key to ensure
that the value of existing manufacturing systems is
preserved. At the same time, it will be necessary to
come up with migration strategies that deliver benefits
from an early stage (see also Chapters 3 and 5.4). Nevertheless,
innovations constituting a quantum leap may
arise in some individual sectors.<br><br>

If German industry is to survive and prosper, it will need
to play an active role in shaping this fourth industrial
revolution. It will be necessary to draw on the traditional
strengths of German industry and the German research
community:<br><br>
--  Market leadership in machinery and plant
manufacturing<br><br>
--  A globally significant cluster of IT competencies<br><br>
--  A leading innovator in embedded systems and
automation engineering<br><br>
--  A highly-skilled and highly-motivated workforce<br><br>
--  Proximity to and in some cases close cooperation
between suppliers and users<br><br>
--  Outstanding research and training facilities<br><br>
In implementing Industrie 4.0, the aim is to create an
optimal overall package by leveraging existing technological
and economic potential through a systematic
innovation process drawing on the skills, performance
and know-how of Germany’s workforce. Industrie 4.0
will focus on the following overarching aspects:<br><br>
--  Horizontal integration through value networks<br><br>
--  End-to-end digital integration of engineering across
the entire value chain<br><br>
--  Vertical integration and networked manufacturing
systems<br><br>
These aspects are considered in more detail in Chapter
3 in the context of the dual strategy.<br><br>


In the fields of production and automation engineering and IT, horizontal integration refers to the integration
of the various IT systems used in the different stages of the manufacturing and business planning processes
that involve an exchange of materials, energy and information both within a company (e.g. inbound logistics,
production, outbound logistics, marketing) and between several different companies (value networks). The
goal of this integration is to deliver an end-to-end solution.<br><br>
In the fields of production and automation engineering and IT, vertical integration refers to the integration of
the various IT systems at the different hierarchical levels (e.g. the actuator and sensor, control, production
management, manufacturing and execution and corporate planning levels) in order to deliver an end-to-end
solution.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>
	
2.2 What will the future look like under
Industrie 4.0?<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 will deliver greater flexibility and robustness
together with the highest quality standards in
engineering, planning, manufacturing, operational and
logistics processes. It will lead to the emergence of
dynamic, real-time optimised, self-organising value
chains that can be optimised based on a variety of
criteria such as cost, availability and resource consumption.<br><br>
This will require an appropriate regulatory
framework as well as standardised interfaces and harmonised
business processes.<br><br>
The following aspects characterise the vision for Industrie
4.0:<br><br>
--  It will be characterised by a new level of sociotechnical
interaction between all the actors and
resources involved in manufacturing. This will
revolve around networks of manufacturing resources
(manufacturing machinery, robots, conveyor
and warehousing systems and production facilities)
that are autonomous, capable of controlling
themselves in response to different situations,
self-configuring, knowledge-based, sensorequipped
and spatially dispersed and that also
incorporate the relevant planning and management
systems. As a key component of this vision, smart
factories will be embedded into inter-company
value networks and will be characterised by
end-to-end engineering that encompasses both
the manufacturing process and the manufactured

product, achieving seamless convergence of the
digital and physical worlds. Smart factories will
make the increasing complexity of manufacturing
processes manageable for the people who work
there and will ensure that production can be
simultaneously attractive, sustainable in an urban
environment and profitable.<br><br>
--  The smart products in Industrie 4.0 are uniquely
identifiable and may be located at all times. Even
while they are being made, they will know the
details of their own manufacturing process. This
means that, in certain sectors, smart products will
be able to control the individual stages of their
production semi-autonomously. Moreover, it will be
possible to ensure that finished goods know the
parameters within which they can function optimally
and are able to recognise signs of wear and
tear throughout their life cycle. This information
can be pooled in order to optimise the smart
factory in terms of logistics, deployment and
maintenance and for integration with business
management applications.
<br><br>
--  In the future under Industrie 4.0, it will be possible
to incorporate individual customer- and productspecific
features into the design, configuration,
ordering, planning, production, operation and
recycling phases. It will even be possible to incorporate
last-minute requests for changes immediately
before or even during manufacturing and
potentially also during operation. This will make it
possible to manufacture one-off items and very
small quantities of goods profitably.<br><br>
--  Implementation of the Industrie 4.0 vision will
enable employees to control, regulate and
configure smart manufacturing resource networks
and manufacturing steps based on situation- and
context-sensitive targets. Employees will be freed
up from having to perform routine tasks, enabling
them to focus on creative, value-added activities.
They will thus retain a key role, particularly in
terms of quality assurance. At the same time,
flexible working conditions will enable greater
compatibility between their work and their
personal needs.<br><br>

--  Implementation of the vision for Industrie 4.0 will
require further expansion of the relevant network
infrastructure and specification of network service
quality through service level agreements. This will
make it possible to meet the need for high bandwidths
for data-intensive applications and for
service providers to guarantee run times for
time-critical applications.<br><br>


The Internet of Things and
Services harbours huge potential
for innovation in manufacturing.<br><br>
If we also succeed
in integrating
Web-based services into
Industrie 4.0 we will increase
the scope of this potential
immeasurably.  <br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Opportunities and models</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
2.3 Novel business opportunities and models
Industrie 4.0 will lead to the development of new business
and partnership models that are far more geared
towards meeting individual, last-minute customer requirements.<br><br>
These models will also enable SMEs to
use services and software systems that they are unable
to afford under current licensing and business models.<br><br>
The new business models will provide solutions to issues
such as dynamic pricing that takes account of
customers’ and competitors’ situations and issues relating
to the quality of service level agreements (SLAs)
in a context characterised by networking and cooperation
between business partners. They will strive to ensure
that the potential business benefits are shared fairly among all the stakeholders in the value chain, including
the new ones. Broader regulatory requirements
such as cutting CO2 emissions (see Chapter 5.8) can
and should be integrated into these business models
so that they can be met collectively by the partners in
the business networks (see Fig. 3).
<br><br>

<a href= "pic10.html">Figure 3: Horizontal value network</a><br><br>

Industrie 4.0 use case scenarios relating e.g. to “networked
manufacturing”, “self-organising adaptive logistics”
and “customer-integrated engineering” will require
business models that will primarily be implemented by
what could be a highly dynamic network of businesses
rather than by a single company. This will raise a number
of questions regarding financing, development, reliability,
risk, liability and IP and know-how protection. As
far as the organisation of the network and the qualified
differentiation of its services is concerned, it will be crucial
to ensure that responsibilities are correctly assigned
within the business network, backed up by the
relevant binding documentation.<br><br>
Detailed monitoring of the business models in real time3
will also play a key role in documenting processing
steps and system statuses to demonstrate that the
contractual and regulatory conditions have been complied with. The individual steps of the business processes
will be tracked at all times, providing documentary
evidence of their completion (see also 5.7). In
order to ensure efficient provision of individual services,
it will be necessary to establish exactly what the relevant
service life cycle might look like, which promises
can be guaranteed and which licence models and conditions
would allow new partners C especially SMEs C
to join the business networks.<br><br>
In view of the above, it is likely that Industrie 4.0 will
give rise to unpredictable global effects and a highly
dynamic environment. The disruptive nature of new
technologies and their impact on legal issues (e.g. with
regard to technology, sensitive corporate data, liability,
data protection, trade restrictions, use of cryptography,
etc) can pose a threat to the enforceability of existing
legislation. Short innovation cycles result in the need
for constant updating of the regulatory framework and
cause chronic failings in terms of enforcement. It will
therefore be necessary to adopt a new approach
whereby technologies are tested for their compatibility
with the law both prior to and during their development
(see Chapter 5.7). Another factor that is key to the success
of the Industrie 4.0 initiative is the topic of safety
and security (see Chapter 5.4). Once again, a far more
proactive approach will be required in this area. Furthermore,
it will be important to ensure that the concept
of Security by Design is not simply confined to functional
components.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">New social infrastructures</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	<a href= "link04.html">《人生七年》（56 Up）</a><br><br>

2.4 New social infrastructures in the workplace
Industrie 4.0 will bring a number of innovations to a
country that is in the throes of demographic change C
Germany has the second oldest population in the
world, after Japan, whilst the average age of the workforce
at many German manufacturing companies is in
the mid-forties. The number of young employees is in
constant decline and there is already a shortage of
skilled labour and applicants for apprenticeships in certain
professions. In order to ensure that demographic
change does not occur at the expense of current living
standards, it will be necessary for Germany to make
better use of its existing labour market reserves for Industrie
4.0 whilst at the same time maintaining and improving the productivity of the workforce. It will be especially
important to increase the proportion of older
people and women in employment. The latest research
indicates that individual productivity does not depend
on a person’s age but is instead connected with the
amount of time they have been in a particular position,
the way that their work is organised and their working
environment. If productivity is to be maintained and increased
over the course of longer working lives, it will
therefore be necessary to coordinate and transform
several different aspects of the workplace, including
health management and work organisation, lifelong
learning and career path models, team structures and
knowledge management.4 This is a challenge that will
have to be met not just by businesses but in particular
also by the education system.<br><br>
Thus, it will not only be new technical, business and legal
factors that determine Germany’s future competitiveness,
it will also be the new social infrastructures in
the Industrie 4.0 workplace that have the capacity to
achieve far greater structural involvement of workers in
the innovation process.<br><br>
An important role will also be played by the paradigm
shift in human-technology and human-environment
interaction brought about by Industrie 4.0, with novel
forms of collaborative factory work that can be performed
outside of the factory in virtual, mobile workplaces.<br><br>
Employees will be supported in their work by
smart assistance systems with multimodal, user-friendly
user interfaces.<br><br>
In addition to comprehensive training and CPD measures,
work organisation and design models will be key
to enabling a successful transition that is welcomed by
the workforce. These models should combine a high
degree of self-regulated autonomy with decentralised
leadership and management approaches. Employees
should have greater freedom to make their own decisions,
become more actively engaged and regulate
their own workload.<br><br>
The socio-technical approach of the Industrie 4.0
initiative will unlock new potential for developing urgently
needed innovations, based on a greater awareness
of the importance of human work in the innovation
process.

	<b><a name="T8">Novel CPS platforms</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
2.5 Novel service-based, real-time enabled
CPS platforms<br><br>
The strategic initiative Industrie 4.0 will give rise to novel
CPS platforms geared towards supporting collaborative
industrial business processes and the associated
business networks for all aspects of smart factories and
smart product life cycles.<br><br>
The services and applications provided by these platforms
will connect people, objects and systems to each
other (see Fig. 4) and will possess the following features:<br><br>
--  Flexibility provided by rapid and simple orchestration
of services and applications, including CPSbased
software<br><br>
--  Simple allocation and deployment of business
processes along the lines of the App Stores model<br><br>
--  Comprehensive, secure and reliable backup of the
entire business process<br><br>
--  Safety, security and reliability for everything from
sensors to user interfaces<br><br>
--  Support for mobile end devices<br><br>
--  Support for collaborative manufacturing, service,
analysis and forecasting processes in business
networks.<br><br>


<a href= "pic11.html">Figure 4: The Internet of Things and Services C Networking people, objects and systems</a><br><br>
In the context of the business networks, there is a particular
need for IT development work with regard to
the orchestration of services and applications on
shared CPS platforms, since this is where the specific
requirements for horizontal and vertical integration of
CPS, applications and services arise in industrial
business processes (see also Chapter 5.1). For Industrie
4.0, it is important to interpret the term ‘orchestration’
more broadly than is usually the case in
the context of web services. It should explicitly include
the setting up of shared services and applications in
collaborative inter-company processes and business
networks. Issues such as safety and security, confidence,
reliability, usage, operator model convergence,
real-time analysis and forecasting will all need to be
reviewed for the orchestration and subsequent effi-

cient, reliable, safe and secure operation of collaborative
manufacturing and service processes as well as
for the execution of dynamic business processes on
CPS platforms. Among other things, this will involve
addressing the challenges posed by the wide range of
different data sources and end devices. The requirements
referred to above are currently met in only a
very rudimentary fashion by generic cloud infrastructure
initiatives. Inter-company use of CPS platforms
by IT, software and service providers and by the users
themselves will require an Industrie 4.0 reference architecture
that will need to take account of the different
perspectives of the ICT and manufacturing industries
(see Chapter 5.1). Modelled methods will be
required to develop new applications and services for
these CPS platforms, in order to manage the complexity
resulting from increasing functionality, customisation,
dynamism and cooperation between different
disciplines and organisations (see Chapter 5.2).<br><br>

Availability of a secure and efficient network infrastructure
with high bandwidths will be key to guaranteeing the
necessary secure data exchange (see Chapter 5.3).<br><br>

2.6 The road to Industrie 4.0<br><br>
Implementing the vision of Industrie 4.0 will involve an evolutionary
process that will progress at different rates in individual
companies and sectors. A survey on the “prospects
for Industrie 4.0” carried out at the beginning of the
year by the professional associations BITKOM, VDMA
and ZVEI confirmed the importance of this topic for the
competitiveness of German industry and documented the
need for fuller and more targeted information (see Fig. 5).<br><br>
Some 47 percent of the companies in the survey5 said
that they were already actively engaged with Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
18 percent of these companies said that they were involved
in research into Industrie 4.0, whilst 12 percent
claimed that they were already putting it into practice.<br><br>

<a href= "pic12.html">Figure 5: Results of survey on Industrie 4.0 trends (January 2013)</a><br><br>
The three greatest challenges connected with implementing
the vision were identified as standardisation,
work organisation and product availability.<br><br>
Alongside active involvement in working groups, other
support measures requested by companies to aid them
with implementation of Industrie 4.0 include targeted
seminars where they can share experiences and regular
newsletters. The professional associations will play
an important role in ensuring a steady flow of communication,
working closely with the social partners, the
academic community and the public. Approximately 50
percent of the companies surveyed said that they had
already received information about Industrie 4.0
through their professional associations.<br><br>
In addition to the above, the Working Group considers
the following measures to be key to enabling a smooth
transition to Industrie 4.0 for businesses:
--  Implementation of real-time enabled CPS solutions
will place high demands on the availability of services
and network infrastructure in terms of space,
technical quality and reliability. In order to secure
Germany’s competitiveness internationally, harmonisation
of services and business models through the
introduction of the relevant international standards
should be supported by policymakers both nationally
and globally (see also Chapters 5.1 and 5.3).<br><br>

--  Business processes in manufacturing are currently
often still static and implemented through extremely
inflexible software systems. However, they cannot
simply be replaced overnight by service-oriented
systems. It will be essential to integrate new
technologies into older ones (or vice versa) C old
systems will need to be upgraded with real-time
enabled systems.<br><br>
--  The rate of development of new business models
for manufacturing in the Internet of Things and
Services will approach the rate of development and
dynamism of the Internet itself.<br><br>
--  Employees will be involved at an early stage in the
innovative socio-technical design of work organisation,
CPD and technological development (see
Chapter 5.5).<br><br>
--  In order to achieve the transition to Industrie 4.0, it
will be necessary for the ICT industry (that is
accustomed to short innovation cycles) to work
closely with machinery and plant manufacturers and
mechatronic system suppliers (who tend to think in
terms of much longer innovation cycles) in order to
develop business models that are acceptable to all
the partners.
<br><br>
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE:<br><br>
In conjunction with smart production, smart logistics, smart grids and smart products, the increasing use
of the Internet of Things and Services in manufacturing will transform value chains and lead to the emergence
of new business models.<br><br>
The strategic initiative Industrie 4.0 will leverage the existing technological and commercial potential. Industrie
4.0 offers the prospect of new business opportunities and innovative new social infrastructures in the
workplace.

3 The dual strategy: becoming a leading market and supplier<br><br>

3 The dual strategy:<br><br>
becoming a leading market and supplier
The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) holds huge
potential for manufacturing industry in Germany. Increased
deployment of CPS in German factories will
strengthen German manufacturing industry by improving
the efficiency of domestic production. At the same time,
the development of CPS technology offers significant
opportunities for exporting technologies and products.<br><br>
Consequently, the implementation of the Industrie 4.0
initiative should aim to leverage the market potential for
German manufacturing industry1 through the adoption
of a dual strategy comprising the deployment of CPS
in manufacturing on the one hand and the marketing
of CPS technology and products in order to strengthen
Germany’s manufacturing equipment industry on
the other.<br><br>
3.1 Leading supplier strategy<br><br>
The leading supplier strategy addresses the potential of
Industrie 4.0 from the point of view of the equipment
supplier industry . German equipment suppliers provide
manufacturing industry with world-leading technological
solutions and are thus in pole position to become global
leaders in the development, production and worldwide
marketing of Industrie 4.0 products. The key is now to
find smart ways of combining outstanding technological
solutions with the new potential offered by information
technology, in order to achieve a quantum leap in innovation.<br><br>
It is this systematic combination of information
and communication technology with traditional high-tech
strategies that will enable rapidly changing markets and
increasingly complex global market processes to be
managed so that companies can carve out new market
opportunities for themselves.<br><br>
--  Existing basic IT technologies need to be adapted
to the specific requirements of manufacturing
and continue to be developed with this
particular application in mind. In order to achieve
economies of scale and ensure widespread
effectiveness, it will be necessary to enhance the
manufacturing technology and IT systems of existing facilities with CPS capabilities as part of
the strategy for migrating to Industrie 4.0. At the
same time, it will be necessary to develop models
and strategies for designing and implementing CPS
manufacturing structures at new sites.<br><br>
--  If Germany wishes to achieve its goal of lasting
leadership as a supplier of Industrie 4.0 equipment,
research, technology and training initiatives
should be promoted as a matter of priority with a
view to developing methodologies and pilot applications
in the field of automation engineering modelling
and system optimisation (see Chapter 5.2).<br><br>
--  Another key challenge will be to use the technology
to create novel value networks. This will
involve developing new business models,
particularly ones that link products with the appropriate
services.<br><br>
3.2 Leading market strategy<br><br>
The leading market for Industrie 4.0 is Germany’s domestic
manufacturing industry. In order to shape and successfully
expand this leading market, close networking of
parts of businesses located at different sites will be required,
together with closer cooperation between different
enterprises. This will in turn require logical, end-toend
digital integration of the different value creation
stages and the life cycles of products, product ranges
and the corresponding manufacturing systems. One particular
challenge will be to achieve simultaneous integration
into these emerging new value networks of
both large-scale undertakings that already operate
globally today and SMEs that often still operate only
at a regional level. The strength of Germany’s manufacturing
industry is in no small measure due to a balanced
structure comprising a large number of small and medium-
sized enterprises and a smaller number of large-scale
undertakings. However, many SMEs are not prepared for
the structural changes that Industrie 4.0 will entail, either
because they lack the requisite specialist staff or because
of a cautious or even sceptical attitude towards a
technology strategy that they are still unfamiliar with. One key strategy for integrating SMEs into global value
networks is therefore the design and implementation
of a comprehensive knowledge and technology
transfer initiative. For example, pilot applications and
best practice examples of networks of large-scale industrial
undertakings and SMEs could help to make the
potential of networked value chains more visible and
convince small and medium-sized enterprises to adopt
the methodological and organisational tools and technologies
of the leading suppliers. This would remove
the barriers to SMEs becoming acquainted with CPS
methodologies, taking them on board and implementing
them in their own businesses.<br><br>
In order to make this possible, it will be essential to accelerate
the use and development of the technological
infrastructure, including high-speed broadband data
transmission (see Chapter 5.3). In parallel, it will also
be important to educate and train skilled workers (see
Chapter 5.6) whilst simultaneously developing customised
and efficient organisational designs for complex
working arrangements (see Chapter 5.5).<br><br>

Germany’s economy is characterised
by its strong industrial
base, particularly its
machinery and plant manufacturing,
automotive and
energy industries. Implementation
of Industrie 4.0 will be
absolutely key to its future
development C we cannot
allow industry to come to a
standstill.  <br><br>

Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology<br><br>


3.3 The dual strategy and its key features<br><br>
Optimal delivery of Industrie 4.0’s goals will only be
possible if the leading supplier and leading market
strategies are coordinated to ensure that their potential
benefits complement each other. Hereafter, this
approach will be referred to as the dual strategy. The
strategy incorporates three key features (see also
Chapter 2.1):<br><br>
--  Development of inter-company value chains and
networks through horizontal integration<br><br>
--  Digital end-to-end engineering across the entire
value chain of both the product and the associated
manufacturing system<br><br>
--  Development, implementation and vertical integration
of flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing
systems within businesses<br><br>
These features are the key enablers for manufacturers
to achieve a stable position in the face of highly volatile
markets whilst flexibly adapting their value creation activities in response to changing market requirements.
The features outlined under this dual CPS strategy will
allow manufacturing companies to achieve rapid, ontime,
fault-free production at market prices in the context
of a highly dynamic market.<br><br>
3.3.1 Horizontal integration through value networks<br><br>
Models, designs and implementations of horizontal integration
through value networks should provide answers
to the following key question:<br><br>
How can companies’ business strategies, new value
networks and new business models be sustainably
supported and implemented using CPS?<br><br>
This question applies in equal measure to the realms
of research, development and application (see Fig. 6).
In addition to “business models” and “forms of cooperation
between different companies”, it is also necessary
to address topics such as “sustainability”, “knowhow
protection”, “standardisation strategies” and
“medium to long-term training and staff development
initiatives”.<br><br>

<a href= "pic13.html">Figure 6:Horizontal integration through value networks；Figure 7: End-to-end engineering across the entire value chain</a><br><br>

3.3.2 End-to-end engineering across the
entire value chain<br><br>
The following key question arises in connection with
the goal of achieving end-to-end digital integration
throughout the engineering process so that the digital
and real worlds are integrated across a product’s entire
value chain and across different companies whilst also
incorporating customer requirements:<br><br>
How can CPS be used to deliver end-to-end business
processes including the engineering workflow?<br><br>
In this regard, modelling plays a key role in managing
the increasing complexity of technological systems
(see Chapter 5.2). The appropriate IT systems should
be deployed in order to provide end-to-end support to
the entire value chain, from product development to
manufacturing system engineering, production and service
(see Fig. 7). A holistic systems engineering approach
is required that spans the different technical
disciplines. For this to be possible, engineers will need
to receive the appropriate training.<br><br>

manufacturing systems<br><br>
As far as vertical integration is concerned, the following
key question needs to be answered:<br><br>
How can CPS be used to create flexible and reconfigurable
manufacturing systems?<br><br>
The setting for vertical integration is the factory. In tomorrow’s
smart factories, manufacturing structures will not
be fixed and predefined. Instead, a set of IT configuration
rules will be defined that can be used on a case-by-case
basis to automatically build a specific structure (topology
) for every situation, including all the associated requirements
in terms of models, data, communication and
algorithms (see Fig. 8).
<br><br>

<a href= "pic14.html">Figure 8: Vertical integration and networked manufacturing systems</a><br><br>
In order to deliver vertical integration, it is essential to
ensure end-to-end digital integration of actuator and
sensor signals across different levels right up to the ERP
level. It will also be necessary to develop modularisation
and reuse strategies in order to enable ad hoc networking
and reconfigurability of manufacturing systems, together
with the appropriate smart system capability descriptions.<br><br>
Moreover, foremen and operators will need to
be trained to understand the impact of these approaches
on the running and operation of the manufacturing
system.
<br><br>
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE:<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 can serve to create horizontal value networks at a strategic level, provide end-to-end integration
across the entire value chain of the business process level, including engineering, and enable vertically
integrated and networked design of manufacturing systems.<br><br>
Implementation of the strategic initiative Industrie 4.0 C both in terms of research funding and concrete development
and implementation measures C should therefore be based on a dual strategy geared towards delivering
the twin goals of creating a leading market among Germany’s manufacturing companies and making
Germany’s manufacturing equipment industry into a leading supplier.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">Research requirements</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
4 Research requirements<br><br>
Although Industrie 4.0 will largely be implemented by
industry itself, there is still a fundamental need for further
research. The Industrie 4.0 Working Group identified
and presented the main medium- and long-term
research requirements and actions in October 2012.<br><br>
These are summarised in the following section.<br><br>
The main aim of Industrie 4.0 is to implement a dual
strategy (see Chapter 3) based on coordination of the
leading supplier and leading market strategies. This
should be supported by research activities. In Industrie
4.0, it is expected that the revolutionary applications
will come about principally as a result of combining ICT
with manufacturing and automation technology.<br><br>
For this to happen, existing CPS features will need to
be adapted in the medium term for deployment in manufacturing
systems. This will require machine and plant
manufacturers’ strengths as integrators to be pooled
with the competencies of the ICT and automation industries
to establish targeted, creative development
processes for creating new CPS. The new level of networking
required to achieve end-to-end integration of
product models, manufacturing resources and manufacturing
systems is going to necessitate a huge research
and development effort in the longer term.
The priority for future research is shifting towards
the investigation and development of fully describable,
manageable, context-sensitive and controllable
or self-regulating manufacturing systems.<br><br>
In the long term, these will consist of functional CPS
components drawn from cross-discipline, modular toolkits
that can either be configured using help functions
or integrate themselves synergistically into an existing
infrastructure during production. It should also be possible
to achieve significantly enhanced integration of
virtually planned and real manufacturing processes. In
the long term, it will therefore be necessary for researchers
to develop modular CPS and the corresponding
component catalogues as a key feature
of any model smart factory.<br><br>
A quantum leap in innovation will only be achieved if
existing basic technologies are developed in an applied
manner to meet the specific requirements of the manufacturing
environment. The resulting methods, approaches and best practice examples will need to be
disseminated across the different levels of the value
networks in order to achieve cross-discipline knowledge
and technology transfer. It is for this reason that
the section on the dual strategy (see Chapter 3) has
already provided an in-depth look at three of the five
central research themes:<br><br>
1. Horizontal integration through value networks<br><br>
2. End-to-end engineering across the entire
value chain<br><br>
3. Vertical integration and networked
manufacturing systems<br><br>
In the long term, this technology-driven research centred
around manufacturing system applications will result
in an increase in inter-company or inter-divisional
interdisciplinary cooperation that will act as a strategic
enabler for predominantly small and medium-sized machinery
and plant manufacturers. This will allow the industry
to respond much more swiftly to market requirements
and establish itself as the leading supplier of a
wide range of new products, services and business
models.<br><br>
However, interdisciplinarity will not come about purely
through greater cooperation between engineers and
automation engineers. The significant impact of the
fourth industrial revolution on the industrial jobs of tomorrow
is something that will have to be addressed
both through research and at a practical level. This
brings us to the fourth research requirement:<br><br>
4. New social infrastructures in the workplace
In the interests of social responsibility, it will be necessary
to increase the involvement and promote the engagement
of employees in terms of using their skills
and experience with regard to both creative design and
planning processes as well as in the operational working
environment. CPS will therefore require new work
organisation structures covering the entire value network
in order to boost employees’ productivity and provide
organisational structures that support individuals’
lifelong development.<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.retter2012.com/">Retter is Better</a>, WE Create and Deliver Real Value!<br><br>

An interdisciplinary approach should be adopted to
these issues, drawing on the expertise of a team
comprising engineers, IT experts, psychologists, ergonomists,
social and occupational scientists, doctors
and designers.<br><br>
The basic overview presented above indicates that
practical methods and basic technologies to enable
collaborative work in the realm of manufacturing and
automation engineering are currently still widely unavailable
in many areas.<br><br>
In order to ensure that they can be used in different companies
and industries with different IT systems, technical
resources and competencies, the basic ICT technologies
need to be adapted to the requirements of automation
engineering. A further key to success will be the
establishment of practical reference architectures.<br><br>
Among other things, this aspect relates to the need to establish service-based, real-time enabled infrastructures
as (or belonging to) ICT platforms for vertical and
horizontal integration as already touched upon in Chapter
2. These infrastructures will need to be standardised
so that they can be used by different companies and
technologically orchestrated in order to enable the widespread
creation of shared business networks through
the establishment of the appropriate web services.<br><br>
This brings us to the final area where research and action
are still required for Industrie 4.0:<br><br>
the business and research communities, builds on the
recommendations of the Communication Promoters
Group that were submitted to the Industry-Science Research
Alliance in two reports in January and September
2011. It remains desirable to implement these recommendations,
together with the outcomes of the
BMBF-sponsored project “Integrated Research Agenda
Cyber-Physical Systems”1 and the BMWi study
“Das wirtschaftliche Potential des Internets der Dienste”
(The Economic Potential of the Internet of Services).<br><br>
Consequently, they should be understood as referring
to the need to adapt basic ICT technologies to the
requirements of automation and manufacturing engineering,
including the continuation of efforts to address
general research requirements in this regard. They
should also be regarded as a concrete description of
the actions required in order to implement the vision
described above for the specific application of “industrial
engineering”.<br><br>
In order to provide ideas and guidance for the make-up
of the relevant funding programmes, the Industrie 4.0
Working Group has furthermore identified the key actions
and research requirements for the medium to
long term.<br><br>


Through Industrie 4.0 we will
also be enabling a paradigm
shift in human-technology
interaction. It will be machines
that adapt to the needs of
human beings and not vice
versa. Smart industrial assistance
systems with multimodal
user interfaces will bring digital
learning technologies directly
into the workplace  <br><br>

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE:<br><br>
An intensive dialogue between the relevant ministries and the Industrie 4.0 Platform will be required in order
to put together a comprehensive funding package for industry and the research community. The Industrie
4.0 Platform should ensure that its Industrial Steering Committee and Scientific Advisory Committee include
experts from the realms of manufacturing, automation and IT, legal and management experts and social
scientists. The Industrie 4.0 Platform’s Working Groups should invite additional experts from the research
and business communities to assist with the immediate task of drawing up comprehensive R&D
roadmaps that adapt the consolidated research recommendations to the specific requirements of each
working group.<br><br>
In addition to facilitating discussions and informal exchanges within the Industrie 4.0 community, the Industrie
4.0 Platform should also identify potential synergies between the various projects and partnerships that
are currently in existence.<br><br>

5 Priority areas for action<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 is a complex initiative that embraces several
partially overlapping areas. In October 2012, the Industrie
4.0 Working Group presented a comprehensive collection
of medium- and long-term research recommendations.<br><br>
The following sections focus on the key priority
areas where the Working Group believes that there is a
need for concrete industrial policy and business decisions
to be taken in order for the recommendations to be
implemented. The Industrie 4.0 Platform was established
in order to shape the implementation process.<br><br>
5.1 Standardisation and open standards for a
reference architecture
If Industrie 4.0 is to enable inter-company networking
and integration through value networks (see Chapter
3), the appropriate standards will need to be developed.
Standardisation efforts will need to focus on
stipulating the cooperation mechanisms and the information
that is to be exchanged. The complete technical
description and implementation of these provisions is
referred to as the reference architecture.<br><br>
The reference architecture is thus a general model
that applies to the products and services of all the

partner companies. It provides a framework for the
structuring, development, integration and operation of
the technological systems relevant to Industrie 4.0. It
is provided in the shape of software applications and
software services (see e.g. Fig. 9).<br><br>
<a href= "pic15.html">Figure 9: Reference architecture for connecting the Internet of Things with the Internet of Services</a><br><br>
Since the value network in Industrie 4.0 comprises
several different companies with very different business
models, the role of the reference architecture is
to pull together these divergent approaches into one
single, common approach. This will require the partners
to agree on the basic structural principles, interfaces
and data.<br><br>
The example of a manufacturing system serves to outline
some of the different perspectives that would
need to be integrated into a reference architecture
(see Fig. 10):<br><br>
--  The perspective of the manufacturing process in
terms of processing and transport functions
--  The perspective of specific networked devices in a
manufacturing system, such as (smart) automation
devices, field devices, fieldbuses, programmable
logic controllers, operating devices, mobile devices,
servers, workstations, Web access devices, etc <br><br>
--  The perspective of the software applications in the
manufacturing environment, such as data acquisition
through sensors, sequential control, continuous
control, interlocking, operational data, machine
data, process data, archiving, trend analysis,
planning and optimisation functions, etc<br><br>
--  The perspective of the software applications used
by one or more businesses, e.g. for business
planning and management, inter-company logistics
or supporting value networks, including the relevant
interfaces and integration with the manufacturing
environment<br><br>
--  The engineering perspective in a manufacturing
system (Product Lifecycle Management/PLM). For
example, this could involve using data derived
from the manufacturing process to plan the
necessary resources (in terms of both machinery
and human resources). It would subsequently be
possible to successively optimise machines in
terms of their mechanical, electrical and automation
technology properties, right up to the point
where the manufacturing system is set up and
brought online, whilst also taking operation and
maintenance into account.<br><br>

<a href= "pic16.html">Figure 10: Examples of the different perspectives included in the Industrie 4.0 reference architecture</a><br><br>
Challenges<br><br>
The first challenge is to pull together the different established
ways of seeing things that currently exist in
the realms of<br><br>
--  production engineering, mechanical engineering,
process engineering,<br><br>
--  automation engineering and<br><br>
--  IT and the Internet<br><br>
and establish a common approach. Since Industrie
4.0 will require cooperation between companies in
the machinery and plant manufacturing, automation
engineering and software sectors, the first step will be
to agree on a common basic terminology.<br><br>
Although several established standards are already in
use by the various technical disciplines, professional
associations and working groups, a coordinated overview
of these standards is currently lacking. It is therefore
necessary for existing standards e.g. in the field
of automation (industrial communication, engineering,
modelling, IT security, device integration, digital factories)
to be incorporated into a new global reference
architecture.<br><br>
The reference architecture cannot be developed in a
top-down manner since it will need to integrate several
different perspectives and a top-down approach would
in any case take far too long. It therefore makes sense
for the reference architecture to be developed incrementally
and from a variety of starting points. In this
regard, it will be necessary for strategies that are currently
often implemented in a project-specific manner
based on local circumstances to be gradually converted
into an international standard. In doing so, it will be
important to ensure that interfaces remain technically
stable for many years to come and to preserve the value
of the installed base. On the Internet, the approach
to standardisation is based on different paradigms to
those that are currently the norm in the machinery and
plant manufacturing industry, for example
--  Open operating systems: in the case of Linux, a
community of businesses, research institutions and
individuals comprising more than 2,000 developers
in over 100 countries develops and maintains one
of the world’s most successful operating systems.<br><br>

--  Open development tools: a community comprising
over 1,500 developers and millions of users
develops software for demanding modelling
applications.<br><br>
--  Open communication infrastructure: “Requests for
Comments” are technical and organisational
documents published through the Internet Society
that were first established as long ago as
07.04.1969. Their widespread acceptance and use
has converted them into de facto standards.<br><br>
Well-known examples include the Internet protocol
(TCP/IP) and e-mail protocol (SMTP).<br><br>
These paradigms enable standardisation efforts to be
progressed far more rapidly.<br><br>
Finally, it will be important to build trust in the reference
architecture. This is particularly relevant with regard to
know-how protection (see Chapter 5.7). It will also be
key to ensure that the full range of intended users of the
reference architecture are appropriately engaged in its
design right from the early stages.<br><br>

Recommended actions<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group recommends the establishment of a Working Group under the auspices of
the Industrie 4.0 Platform to deal exclusively with the topic of standardisation and a reference architecture. The
Working Group’s remit would include the following tasks:<br><br>
--  Building a shared understanding of the goals, benefits, potential and risks, possible content and implementation
strategies with a view to creating the mutual confidence needed to support joint implementation
measures. The professional associations should take the lead with regard to the implementation of
confidence-building measures.<br><br>
--  Alignment of the key terminology and subsequent production of a common “Industrie 4.0 glossary”. In
addition, detailed attention should to be paid to those aspects of the following issues that are relevant to
the specific content of Industrie 4.0:<br><br>
--  Model universals (underlying core models, reference models, architecture designs)<br><br>
--  Standards for the Industrie 4.0 service architecture<br><br>
--  Standards for a supra-automation level procedural and functional description<br><br>
--  Terminology standards and the use of ontologies<br><br>
--  Understanding of autonomous and self-organising systems, including their planning, operation and
security<br><br>
--  Characteristics maintenance and system structure description<br><br>
--  Approach to migrating existing architectures
<br><br>

--  Production of a bottom-up map outlining the standardisation bodies that currently exist today. Current,
established “automation reference architecture” approaches and examples would then be located on the
map. This could serve as a basis for assessing the different themes with regard to further development
and migration in the context of Industrie 4.0 and identifying clusters of themes that are not currently
covered.<br><br>
--  Starting work on the production of a top-down roadmap, taking account of cost-benefit considerations
and time constraints. A holistic approach should be adopted in order to strike a sensible balance between
standardisation and individuality. The structure should be open and transparent and all the stakeholders
should be engaged in the development and use of the standards. Licensing models should also be
addressed.<br><br>
--  Development of an “Industrie 4.0 community” with members from several different companies that
feels responsible for the technical implementation of the reference architecture and is able to roll it out
and maintain it in the longer term. This will require a suitable licensing model and an appropriate community
process to be chosen.<br><br>
--  Other tasks forming part of the Working Group’s remit would include moderation, recommendations,
evaluation, communication and motivation.<br><br>
The Working Group also recommends the establishment of appropriate flagship projects to demonstrate the
successful development and deployment of reference architectures. Figure 11 provides an example of a possible
reference architecture focused on horizontal integration through value networks.<br><br>
Other topics for reference architectures could include end-to-end engineering of products and their associated
manufacturing systems or real-time process communication for the management and control of highly
dynamic technological manufacturing processes.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Managing complex systems</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>
	
5.2 Managing complex systems<br><br>
Products and their associated manufacturing systems
are becoming more and more complex. This is a result of
increasing functionality, increasing product customisation,
increasingly dynamic delivery requirements, the increasing
integration of different technical disciplines and
organisations and the rapidly changing forms of cooperation
between different companies.<br><br>
Modelling can act as an enabler for managing this growing
complexity. Models are a representation of a real or
hypothetical scenario that only include those aspects
that are relevant to the issue under consideration. The
use of models constitutes an important strategy in the
digital world and is of central importance in the context
of Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
A fundamental distinction can be drawn between two
types of model:<br><br>

--  Planning models provide transparency with regard
to the creative value-added generated by engineers
and thus make it possible for complex systems to
be built. An example of a planning model would be
a schematic used by an engineer to explain how he
or she has implemented appropriate functions to
meet the requirements placed on a system. As
such, the model contains the engineer’s knowledge.<br><br>
--  Explanatory models describe existing systems in
order to acquire knowledge about the system
through the model. This typically involves using
different analysis processes such as simulation. For
example, a simulation can be used to calculate a
factory’s energy consumption. Explanatory models
are often used to validate engineers’ design
choices.<br><br>

The digital world thus exerts a significant influence over
real-world design via planning models, whilst the real
world also influences the models used in the digital
world via explanatory models.1<br><br>
The fact that models usually contain formal descriptions
means that they can be processed by computers,
allowing the computer to take over routine engineering
tasks such as performing calculations or other repetitive
jobs. One of the benefits of models is therefore
that they allow manual activities to be automated and
enable actions to be performed in the digital world that
previously had to be performed in the real world.<br><br>
Models offer huge potential C and not only in the context
of Industrie 4.0. For example, they allow the risks
involved in a project to be reduced through early detection
of errors or early verification of the demands placed
on the system and the ability of proposed solutions to
meet these demands. Or they can provide a transparent
information flow that enables more efficient engineering
by improving interdisciplinary cooperation and
facilitating more consistent engineering data.<br><br>
Explanatory models that describe interactions and behaviours
in the real world are not only useful for validation
purposes during the development and design
stages. In the future, they will be primarily deployed
during the production stage in order to check that production is running smoothly, detect wear and tear without
needing to halt production or predict component
failure and other disruptions.<br><br>
Challenges<br><br>
Particularly in SMEs, it is still not standard practice to
use model-based simulations in order to configure
and optimise manufacturing processes. One major
challenge for Industrie 4.0 will therefore be to raise
awareness of models’ potential among the wider engineering
community and equip engineers with methods
and tools for using appropriate models to depict
real-world systems in the virtual world (see Chapter
5.6). There are some scenarios (e.g. chemical interactions
during production) where suitable models simply
do not exist or where it is hard to describe them in
a formal model.<br><br>
The explicit development of models for Industrie 4.0 will
initially involve a higher financial outlay than approaches
that do not explicitly use modelling. This is because a
value-added activity is being brought forward to an earlier
stage in the process in order to reduce costs later
on. This immediately raises the question of whether modelling
is cost-effective. The answer is obviously very dependent
on the type of business in question. Companies
are likelier to accept higher initial investment levels in industries
with high production volumes (such as the automotive industry) or industries with stringent
safety standards (such as the avionics2 sector).<br><br>
They are less likely to do so if they only manufacture
small volumes or make individual products. The percentage
of costs associated with customer-specific activities
vs. customer-independent activities also plays an important
role in this regard. It is key to the success of models
that they should be developed cost-effectively and that
they should be used productively not just during the design
stage but also in the subsequent stages, including
operation.<br><br>
Modelling and simulation can only be carried out by
qualified experts. It is therefore important that the relevant
companies should provide these experts with the
appropriate career opportunities. Currently, employees
of SMEs in the mechanical engineering sector who are qualified in this area are largely regarded as “oddballs”.
Finally, a holistic approach should be adopted to the
“introduction” of modelling for Industrie 4.0. Firstly, it
will be necessary to take the product and manufacturing
system into account, both in terms of equipping
them with a modular design and ensuring the involvement
of different disciplines (e.g. manufacturing
engineering, automation engineering and IT). Secondly,
the actual development, engineering and manufacturing
processes occurring in the factory will also
have to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Lastly,
modelling requires efficient software tools that will
have to be optimised and adapted to provide the necessary
functionality, enable them to be integrated with
existing tools and processes, and bring them into line
with the roll-out strategy.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic17.html">Figure 11: Example reference architecture for a CPS platform</a><br><br>
Recommended actions<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group recommends the establishment of a Working Group under the auspices of
the Industrie 4.0 Platform to deal exclusively with the topic of modelling as a means of managing complex
systems, particularly in the realm of manufacturing engineering. The Working Group’s remit should include
the following tasks:<br><br>
--  A representative survey should be carried out to establish the most pressing requirements in the field of
modelling, in order to narrow down this very broad subject area to the most important aspects in terms of
implementation.<br><br>
--  Best practice sharing should be carried out, particularly among SMEs, in order to promote the fundamental
importance of modelling among both practitioners and decision-makers. Potential themes could include
modularisation, virtual start-up or digital plant. In addition, appropriate events should be arranged to enable
discussion of entry barriers and migration strategies (cf. the request for more information expressed in the
survey conducted by the professional associations, Chapter 2). Moderation should also be provided for
communities and expert pools that would act as a one-stop shop for answering questions about modelling
from (potential) users.<br><br>
--  The Working Group should encourage the establishment of common user groups for tool users, tool
manufacturers (product managers, architects) and trainers with a view to participants gaining a better mutual
understanding of each other’s situations. As the leading suppliers under the Industrie 4.0 initiative, the focus
should be on the “machinery and plant manufacturing” target user group, in order to provide tool manufacturers
with a platform for optimally addressing their requirements (e.g. in relation to integration, end-to-end
capability, shortcomings and potential). It would be desirable to invite existing user groups for specific
engineering tools to provide their input on the relevant topics.<br><br>
--  In addition, the Working Group should work on the development of the appropriate guidelines and recommended
actions.<br><br>

In addition to the activities of the Platform, targeted efforts should be made in terms of training and continuing
professional development provision with regard to modelling and systems engineering. This includes both appropriate
training provision for young engineers and appropriate CPD measures for experienced engineers.<br><br>
Training content should be specifically geared towards the requirements of manufacturing companies (see
Chapters 5.5 and 5.6).<br><br>
The Working Group also recommends the establishment of the appropriate flagship projects to deploy and test
existing modelling methods and tools in order to demonstrate the value of modelling in different situations (engineering
vs. operation, mass production vs. small volumes or individual products, manufacturing industry vs. process
industry, in-house vs. inter-company, production vs. logistics, etc).<br><br>

5.3 Delivering a comprehensive broadband infrastructure for industry<br><br>
If CPS are rolled out on a widespread basis, it will in
general terms be necessary to build an infrastructure
that enables significantly higher-volume and higher-quality
data exchange than provided by current communication
networks. A core requirement for Industrie 4.0 is
therefore the enhancement of existing communication
networks to provide guaranteed latency times, reliability,
quality of service and universally available bandwidth. In
keeping with the recommendation of the National IT
Summit presented in the 2011 Digital Infrastructure
Yearbook, broadband Internet infrastructure needs to be
expanded on a massive scale, both in Germany and between
Germany and its manufacturing partner countries.<br><br>
 
“High operational reliability and data link availability are
crucial for mechanical engineering and automation engineering
applications. Guaranteed latency times and
stable connections are key, since they have a direct impact
on application performance. […] Network operators
should do more to meet the wishes of businesses.<br><br>
--  Binding and reliable SLAs (Service Level Agreements)<br><br>
--  Availability and performance of traffic capacity<br><br>
--  Support for data link debugging/tracing, especially
provision of the relevant technical aids<br><br>

--  Provision of widely available/guaranteed traffic
capacity (fixed/guaranteed broadband)<br><br>
--  SMS delivery status notification across all mobile
network operators<br><br>
--  Standardised Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) for provisioning covering all providers (SIM
card activation/deactivation)<br><br>
--  Tariff management<br><br>
--  Cost control of mobile service contracts<br><br>
--  Quality of service (fixed bandwidth)<br><br>
--  Affordable global roaming<br><br>
--  Widely available embedded SIM cards<br><br>
--  Satellite-based solutions for areas with no reception
[N.B. in sparsely populated areas].”<br><br>
This basic infrastructure is required not just for Industrie
4.0 but for all CPS applications, including those in
the areas of energy and healthcare (see Chapter 2.1).<br><br>
Challenges<br><br>
The overall requirements for an effective broadband infrastructure
that is accessible to a large number of users
are simplicity, scalability, security, availability and
affordability.<br><br>

Recommended actions<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group strongly recommends implementation of the recommendations for expanding
Germany’s broadband Internet infrastructure proposed by Working Group 2 “Digital Infrastructure” at the
2011 National IT Summit. It will be necessary to carry out studies of concrete applications in order to establish
the exact bandwidths and real-time capabilities required for Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
In accordance with the recommendations of Working Group 2, the Industrie 4.0 Working Group also recommends
expansion of Germany’s broadband Internet infrastructure.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Safety and security</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
5.4 Safety and security as critical factors for
the success of Industrie 4.0<br><br>
Safety and security are two key aspects with regard
to manufacturing facilities and the products they
make (see info panel). On the one hand, they should
not pose a danger either to people or to the environment
(safety), whilst on the other both production facilities
and products C and in particular the data and
know-how they contain C need to be protected
against misuse and unauthorised access (security).<br><br>
In contrast to security, safety issues have been an
important consideration in the design of manufacturing
facilities and the products they make for many
years. Safety is regulated by a whole host of regulations
and standards governing the construction and
operation of such systems.4<br><br>
Since information technology first came into contact
with mechanics and electronics towards the end of
the 1960s (Industrie 3.05) there has been a dramatic
increase in safety and security requirements in the
manufacturing environment. In addition to the fact
that it became far more complex to provide hard evidence
of operational safety, it gradually became apparent
that security was also a problem. Many of the
safety and security issues that arose in Industrie 3.0
(the “beta version” of Industrie 4.0) have yet to be
fully resolved. Security measures in particular are often
slow to be implemented and frequently only provide
partial fixes. With the advent of Industrie 4.0, a
number of additional safety and security requirements
are set to arise. Industrie 4.0’s CPS-based

manufacturing systems involve highly networked system
structures incorporating large numbers of human
beings, IT systems, automation components and machines.<br><br>
High-volume and often time-critical data and
information exchange occurs between the technological
system components, many of which act autonomously.<br><br>
At the same time, a far greater number of actors
is involved across the value chain (see Chapters 2
and 3). However, safety and security are always properties
of the entire system. Thus, in addition to operational
safety issues, the extensive networks and at least
hypothetical potential for third-party access mean that
a whole new range of security issues arise in the context
of Industrie 4.0. It will only be possible to implement
Industrie 4.0 and get people to accept it if the
following points are put into practice:<br><br>
1. Security by Design as a key design principle. In
the past, security against external attacks was usually
provided by physical measures such as access
restrictions or other centralised security measures. In
CPS-based manufacturing systems, it is not enough
simply to add security features on to the system at
some later point in time. All aspects relating to safety,
and in particular security, need to be designed into
the system from the outset.<br><br>
2. IT security strategies, architectures and standards
need to be developed and implemented in
order to confer a high degree of confidentiality, integrity and availability on the interactions between these
highly networked, open and heterogeneous components.<br><br>
They also need to provide an appropriate, reliable
and affordable solution for protecting the digital
process know-how, intellectual property rights and
data in general of each individual manufacturer and
operator, both vis-à-vis the outside world and with
regard to components belonging to different operators
and/or manufacturers vis-à-vis each other (see
also Chapter 5.7).<br><br>
In Industrie 4.0, it is therefore always necessary to
adopt a global approach to safety and security. It is
essential to consider the impact of security measures
(cryptographic processes or authentication procedures)
on safety (time-critical functions, resource availability) and vice versa (“does a particular critical
safety function of a subsystem increase the risk of
cyber-attacks?”).<br><br>
Furthermore, in view of the current situation, a dual
strategy is also required for Industrie 4.0 with regard to
safety and security. Firstly, existing factories will have to
be upgraded with the safety and security measures
needed to meet the new requirements. The typically
long service lives of machinery and short innovation cycles,
together with heterogeneous and in some cases
very old infrastructures that are difficult to network
mean that this will not be an easy task. Secondly, solutions
for new factories and machinery will have to be
developed. The transition from the third to the fourth
industrial revolution should be as seamless as possible
and should be implemented in a way that can be clearly understood by all the relevant stakeholders. One key
aspect for both pillars of the strategy is for all the actors
throughout the entire value chain to reach a consensus
on safety and security issues and the relevant architecture
before implementation begins.<br><br>

“Safety” refers to the fact that technological systems (machines, production facilities, products, etc) should
not pose a danger either to people or to the environment, whilst “security” refers to the fact that the system
itself needs to be protected against misuse and unauthorised access (access protection, security against
attacks, data and information security). Various aspects of safety and security are relevant to Industrie 4.0,
making it essential to draw a clear distinction between the two terms:<br><br>
Security/IT security/cyber-security: The protection of data and services in (digital) systems against misuse,
e.g. unauthorised access, modification or destruction. The goals of security measures are to increase
confidentiality (the restriction of access to data and services to specific machines/human users), integrity
(accuracy/completeness of data and correct operation of services) and availability (a means of measuring
a system’s ability to perform a function in a particular time). Depending on the technological system in question
and the data and services that it incorporates, security provides the basis for information privacy, i.e.
the protection of individuals against infringements of their personal data rights. It also enables know-how
protection, i.e. protection of intellectual property rights.<br><br>
Safety: The absence of unacceptable risks and threats to people and the environment resulting from operation
of the system. “Safety” requires both operational safety and a high degree of reliability. Depending
on the technological system in question, safety may also involve additional aspects such as prevention of
mechanical or electrical hazards, radiation protection, prevention of hazards relating to steam or high pressure,
etc. Operational safety refers to the aspects of safety that are dependent on the correct operation of
the system or that are provided by the system itself. The elements required to deliver operational safety include
low fault rates, high fault tolerance (i.e. the ability to keep operating correctly even when faults occur)
and robustness (the ability to guarantee basic functionality in the event of a fault). Reliability refers to the
probability of a (technological) system operating correctly for a given period of time in a given environment.

<br><br>
Challenges<br><br>
There are a variety of different challenges facing safety
and security in the context of Industrie 4.0. Quite apart
from the technical challenges, successful safety and
security solutions will also have to address commercial,
psychological and educational issues. For example, industry
currently lacks fully standardised operating platforms
for implementing adequate safety and security
solutions that have been tailored to the specific requirements
of industry in terms of their implementation and
cost so that they do not merely become regarded as
cost drivers. There is often little that can be done to
expand or upgrade existing infrastructure, especially
since many safety and security solutions were originally
developed for other industries or applications. Moreover,
security awareness often plays a key role, particularly
with regard to IT security issues. There are currently
too many discrepancies regarding the level of
security awareness in different industries. In view of the
fact that Industrie 4.0 will involve increased networking
and cooperation between several different partners in a
value chain, it will be necessary for partners to have a
higher level of confidence in each other’s competence
(security & trust) and for them to provide hard evidence
of their competence.<br><br>
Machinery and plant manufacturers are becoming increasingly
aware of the value-added potential of software,
resulting in a sharp rise in the number of software
components found in manufacturing facilities and machinery.
However, too little is often still known about the
relevant IT threats. Industrial IT security has only started
to be discussed in the automation industry since the
public debate surrounding malware such as Stuxnet,
Duqu or Flame. Moreover, software is also playing an
increasingly important role in delivering and maintaining
security and safety, but this is something that has
not yet been properly taken on board by manufacturing
processes C and where solutions are available they
have yet to be implemented.<br><br>
In general terms, Industrie 4.0 will require a much more
proactive approach to safety and security than has hitherto
been the case (especially with regard to security
by design). At the moment, safety and security issues
are often only raised reactively once the development
process is over and specific safety or security problems
have already occurred. However, this belated implementation
of safety and security solutions is both
costly and also often fails to deliver a permanent solution
to the relevant problem. Consequently, safety and
security cannot simply be broken down into functional
components but should instead be approached as a
process. In order to achieve fast response times, it is
also important to provide support through monitoring
and comprehensive cross-sectoral information exchanges.
At the moment, there is insufficient monitoring
of risk assessment indicators, particularly with regard
to industrial IT security, and little if any information
is exchanged about safety and security incidents. Action
in these areas would help to stop the spread of viruses
or indiscriminate cyber-attacks.<br><br>
Recommended actions<br><br>
As part of its study of cyber-security issues, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) drew up a list6
of the top 10 most critical threats currently facing Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The Industrie 4.0 Working
Group has worked together with a number of experts to produce a complementary list of eight priority areas
for action in the field of safety and security:<br><br>
1. Integrated safety and security strategies, architectures and standards
Industrie 4.0 will require modified safety and security strategies, together with systematic application of the
relevant principles and methods throughout the entire system life cycle. A common “knowledge pool” should
be developed as a basis for this approach. This would enable the strategies and processes currently used
in the process automation and mechanical and electrical engineering industries to be enhanced by adapting
the safety and security strategies and processes employed by the IT, automotive and aerospace industries
to the specific requirements of Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
--  Research is needed to develop safety and security strategies for hypothetically open, collaborative
subsystems belonging to different manufacturers and operators. These strategies should be based on
threat scenarios that could initially be developed for individual sectors such as the mechanical engineering
or automotive supply industries, but which would ultimately have to be applicable to all industries.<br><br>
--  It is important to ensure that research and development of the relevant strategies and systems is
closely coordinated with other safety and security research projects on topics such as secure proof of
identity, cyber-security or the protection of critical infrastructure and that knowledge is exchanged with
other industries such as the automotive and aerospace industries.<br><br>
--  Building on these strategies, safety and security architectures for manufacturing systems should be
defined as reference architectures for the Industrie 4.0 initiative. As far as possible, these should be
backwards compatible with existing Industrie 3.0 systems.<br><br>
In addition to ensuring the standardisation of approaches and procedures that is key to the success of Industrie
4.0, these reference architectures would also enable test procedures to be defined and testing facilities
to be established that could be used to test the overall safety and security of systems at every level,
from the individual machine to networks of machines and the application stage. The reference architectures
could also serve as a basis for issuing security classifications and certificates to new and especially to existing
subsystems. This approach would thus form part of the migration strategy.<br><br>
2. Unique and secure IDs for products, processes and machines<br><br>
Secure information exchange throughout the entire manufacturing process is key to the acceptance and
success of Industrie 4.0. This applies to machines, their components, the data being exchanged, the affected
processes and the organisational units involved. To enable this exchange, it is necessary for the individual
machines, processes, products, components and materials to possess unique electronic IDs. Furthermore,
it would be desirable to issue components with a kind of “security passport” containing details of
the risks that were already taken into account and counteracted during development and the risks that need
to be considered by the integrator, installer, operator or user. The passports would also contain the security
classification referred to above.<br><br>

As part of a secure ID, these passports could form the basis of a system for rating the overall security of a CPS
in the manufacturing environment, both during its development and during production itself. The security rating
would take into account the value of the product, the potential threats and the modified or appropriate countermeasures.
The strategic initiative on “Secure Identities” should thus be expanded to include “products”,
“machines” and “processes” and should incorporate virtual products as well as physical ones.<br><br>
3. A migration strategy from Industrie 3.0 to Industrie 4.0<br><br>
The goal of a migration strategy would be to gradually improve the security of current Industrie 3.0 facilities
(which are likely to remain in use for some considerable time) and prepare them for conversion to Industrie
4.0. However, the heterogeneity, long service lives and individual nature of existing manufacturing facilities
all hamper the development of common standards for IT security solutions. Consequently, in addition to the
abovementioned assessment of the current status of existing facilities, a migration strategy will also require
the development of a standardised process model that enables individual security solutions to be implemented
rapidly, pragmatically and cost-effectively. This process could be arrived at by adapting existing
(generic) IT security processes, based on the definition of individual security goals, a situation analysis in
order to identify weaknesses and threats and the subsequent establishment of a list of measures which
would then be implemented.<br><br>
4. User-friendly safety and security solutions<br><br>
People tend to avoid using processes and applications that are not user-friendly. This can have fatal consequences
for safety and security solutions, especially in a highly networked environment. It is therefore necessary
to develop safety and security solutions that are geared towards users’ needs, possess user-friendly
interfaces and therefore guarantee execution of the application in question. These factors should be taken
into account from the initial design phases through engineering and operation right up to and including
maintenance.<br><br>
5. Safety and security in a business management context<br><br>
Inevitably, safety and security are always going to be cost factors. When machinery breaks down, there can
be both a direct impact (e.g. lower turnover) and an indirect impact (e.g. compensation claims from customers,
suppliers and partners or damage to the company’s image). However, until now few manufacturers have
taken out insurance against damage caused by IT issues. It is therefore necessary to develop methods that
will enable clearer calculation of the risks associated with Industrie 4.0 and the cost-effectiveness of the
relevant security solutions as opposed to the alternative of shutting down manufacturing facilities in the
event of a real or suspected IT threat.<br><br>
6. Secure protection against product piracy<br><br>
Successful products are inevitably going to be targeted by product piracy. In a global market, intellectual
property protection is therefore key to the survival of high-wage economies.7 The problems associated with
this phenomenon are not confined to its impact on sales but also include damage to corporate image and
loss of know-how. In the most extreme cases, erstwhile pirates can even become competitors. Moreover, the
problem is no longer restricted to the often rather complex physical replication of products C the targeted
theft of corporate and product know-how is now also becoming increasingly common, especially in the form
of software or configurations that are currently still easy to copy.As part of a secure ID, these passports could form the basis of a system for rating the overall security of a CPS
in the manufacturing environment, both during its development and during production itself. The security rating
would take into account the value of the product, the potential threats and the modified or appropriate countermeasures.
The strategic initiative on “Secure Identities” should thus be expanded to include “products”,
“machines” and “processes” and should incorporate virtual products as well as physical ones.<br><br>
3. A migration strategy from Industrie 3.0 to Industrie 4.0<br><br>
The goal of a migration strategy would be to gradually improve the security of current Industrie 3.0 facilities
(which are likely to remain in use for some considerable time) and prepare them for conversion to Industrie
4.0. However, the heterogeneity, long service lives and individual nature of existing manufacturing facilities
all hamper the development of common standards for IT security solutions. Consequently, in addition to the
abovementioned assessment of the current status of existing facilities, a migration strategy will also require
the development of a standardised process model that enables individual security solutions to be implemented
rapidly, pragmatically and cost-effectively. This process could be arrived at by adapting existing
(generic) IT security processes, based on the definition of individual security goals, a situation analysis in
order to identify weaknesses and threats and the subsequent establishment of a list of measures which
would then be implemented.<br><br>
4. User-friendly safety and security solutions<br><br>
People tend to avoid using processes and applications that are not user-friendly. This can have fatal consequences
for safety and security solutions, especially in a highly networked environment. It is therefore necessary
to develop safety and security solutions that are geared towards users’ needs, possess user-friendly
interfaces and therefore guarantee execution of the application in question. These factors should be taken
into account from the initial design phases through engineering and operation right up to and including
maintenance.<br><br>
5. Safety and security in a business management context<br><br>
Inevitably, safety and security are always going to be cost factors. When machinery breaks down, there can
be both a direct impact (e.g. lower turnover) and an indirect impact (e.g. compensation claims from customers,
suppliers and partners or damage to the company’s image). However, until now few manufacturers have
taken out insurance against damage caused by IT issues. It is therefore necessary to develop methods that
will enable clearer calculation of the risks associated with Industrie 4.0 and the cost-effectiveness of the
relevant security solutions as opposed to the alternative of shutting down manufacturing facilities in the
event of a real or suspected IT threat.<br><br>
6. Secure protection against product piracy<br><br>
Successful products are inevitably going to be targeted by product piracy. In a global market, intellectual
property protection is therefore key to the survival of high-wage economies.7 The problems associated with
this phenomenon are not confined to its impact on sales but also include damage to corporate image and
loss of know-how. In the most extreme cases, erstwhile pirates can even become competitors. Moreover, the
problem is no longer restricted to the often rather complex physical replication of products C the targeted
theft of corporate and product know-how is now also becoming increasingly common, especially in the form
of software or configurations that are currently still easy to copy.<br><br>

Protection against product piracy assumes even greater importance in Industrie 4.0 in view of the much
higher degree of cooperation between the different partners in the value network. It is therefore necessary to
work at a technical level and in particular at the corporate and competition law levels to find solutions that
guarantee trust and transparency within the platform whilst at the same time protecting critical business knowhow.<br><br>
7. Training and (in-house) CPD<br><br>
A knowledge of IT security issues is essential for all the members of an organisation. It is crucial to raise
awareness among all the people involved in production, from skilled machine operators to security software
developers and planning engineers working in the field of plant engineering. When security solutions are
implemented in a business, it is not enough simply to install a technical product, even if it is user-friendly (see
point 4) C employees also need to be adequately trained with regard to the relevant security requirements.<br><br>
Appropriate awareness-raising campaigns targeted at the manufacturing environment could help to overcome
the current shortcomings in this area, whilst the introduction of compulsory classes on this topic at
higher education institutions would help prepare the workforce of the future (see also Chapter 5.6).<br><br>
8. “Community building” for data protection in Industrie 4.0<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 will require tougher data protection arrangements, for example because it will be technically
possible to record and analyse information about employees’ health via the machines in smart factories or
through smart assistance systems. The use of personal information is an especially sensitive issue in Germany,
where there is much focus on the right to informational self-determination. Consequently, it is recommended
that the topic of data protection should be addressed in close cooperation with the strategic initiative
on “Secure Identities”, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the Federal and regional Data
Protection Commissioners and the trade unions and company works councils (see Chapter 5.7).<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Platform will need to engage in an in-depth discussion in order to establish priorities with a
view to drawing up a roadmap or producing a list of requirements. When envisaging the optimal solution for
Industrie 4.0, it will be important to consider not just how to deliver secure communication between machines
and components but also the inherent security of individual machines. It is recommended that the focus should
be on pragmatic solutions that can be promptly implemented in existing facilities without having to wait for the
longer-term “ideal” solutions to be developed (see Chapter 2.1).<br><br>
Germany is a world leader in both complex IT security solutions and in the field of safety, whilst Germany’s
safety and security experts enjoy an excellent reputation right across the globe. However, conventional IT security
products are predominantly produced in other countries such as the US and Israel. In parallel to the
development of CPS and CPS products, Germany has an opportunity to build its own security industry for
Industrie 4.0, drawing on the competitive advantage provided by its specific know-how in manufacturing and
automation processes, mechatronic engineering and embedded systems. It will be important to act swiftly to
ensure that this advantage is used to its full potential in Industrie 4.0.<br><br>

5.5 Work organisation and work design in the
digital industrial age<br><br>
What impact will Industrie 4.0 have in the workplace?
What responsibilities will have to be met by businesses
and society in a decentralised high-tech economy
where CPS are commonplace? How should the
world of work respond to these changes? In a future
characterised by increasing automation and real-time
oriented control systems, how can we ensure that
people’s jobs are good, safe and fair? The answers
to these questions will determine whether or not it is
possible to mobilise existing reserves of innovation
and productivity and secure a competitive advantage
through the widespread deployment of automatically
controlled, knowledge-based, sensor-equipped manufacturing
systems.<br><br>

Innovation efforts cannot be allowed to focus exclusively
on overcoming the technological challenges.<br><br>

The remit of innovation needs to be consistently widened
to include smart organisation of work and employees’
skills, since employees will play a key part in
implementing and assimilating technological innovations.<br><br>
It is likely that their role will change significantly
as a result of the increase in open, virtual work platforms
and extensive human-machine and human-system
interactions. Work content, work processes and
the working environment will be dramatically transformed
in a way that will have repercussions for flexibility,
working time regulation, healthcare, demographic
change and people’s private lives. As a result, in
order to achieve successful integration of tomorrow’s
technologies they will need to be smartly embedded
into an innovative social organisation (within the workplace).
<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 will require the
development of technological
and organisational solutions
that are adapted to the needs
of small and medium-sized
enterprises. It will be necessary
to take advantage of the
specialist know-how within
businesses. Worker-friendly
work organisation and workplace-
based training will be
key to its implementation. <br><br>
Dr. Georg Schütte
Federal Ministry of Education and Research
State Secretary<br><br>

Challenges<br><br>
It is very likely that the nature of work in Industrie 4.0
will place significantly higher demands on all members
of the workforce in terms of managing complexity, abstraction
and problem-solving. Employees will also be
expected to be able to act much more on their own initiative
and to possess excellent communication skills
and the ability to organise their own work. In short,
greater demands will be placed on employees’ subjective
skills and potential. This will provide opportunities
in terms of qualitative enrichment of their work, a more
interesting working environment, greater autonomy and
more opportunities for self-development.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the demands of the new, virtual workplace
also present a threat to the maintenance and
safeguarding of human capital. As the degree of technological
integration increases, there is a danger of employees
being required to be more flexible and perform
more demanding tasks, as well as a growing tension
between the virtual world and the world of workers’
own experience. This could result in workers experiencing
a loss of control and a sense of alienation from their
work as a result of the progressive dematerialisation
and virtualisation of business and work processes. It is
also possible that “old” and “new” threats could combine
to take on a new dimension, resulting in significant
creativity and productivity losses and a tendency for
employees to overwork themselves.<br><br>
Finally, it is important to consider the impact that the
increasing presence of IT in manufacturing industry
will have on headcount. It is likely that the number of
simple manual tasks will continue to decline. This
could pose a threat to at least some employee groups,
notably semi-skilled workers. Such a scenario would
be unacceptable both for the employees themselves
and from the wider public’s point of view in terms of
the social inclusion dimension. Moreover, it would seriously
hamper the successful implementation of the
Industrie 4.0 initiative.<br><br>
A consistent approach to technology and work
organisation<br><br>
Smart factories provide an opportunity to create a new
workplace culture geared towards the interests of the
workforce. However, this potential will not simply be realised
of its own accord. It will be crucial to employ
work organisation and design models that combine a
high degree of individual responsibility and autonomy
with decentralised leadership and management approaches
that allow employees greater freedom to
make their own decisions, be more involved and regulate
their own workload, whilst at the same time also
enabling flexible working arrangements.<br><br>
It is possible to use the technology for very different
ends. Systems can be set up to impose restrictive control
over every minute detail of a person’s work, or they
can be configured as an open source of information
that employees use as a basis for taking their own decisions.
In other words, the quality of people’s work will
not be determined by the technology or by any technological
constraints but rather by the scientists and managers
who model and implement smart factories.<br><br>
It is therefore necessary to adopt a socio-technical
approach where work organisation, continuing professional
development measures and technology and
software architectures are developed in close conjunction
with each other to provide a single, consistent
solution focused on enabling smart, cooperative
and self-organised interactions between employees
and/or technology operating systems across the entire
value chain.<br><br>
“Better, not cheaper” as an opportunity and
benchmark for industrial change<br><br>
This socio-technical approach argues that adopting an
even more extreme version of the Taylorist approach to
work organisation based on frequent repetition of highly
standardised and monotonous tasks is hardly the most
promising way to go about implementing the Industrie
4.0 initiative in partnership with employees in a way that
allows new efficiency gains to be achieved. The fact that
smart factories will be configured as highly complex, dynamic
and flexible systems means that they will need
employees who are empowered to act as decision-makers
and controllers. For this to be possible, they will
need to be supported by customer-oriented job profiles
requiring broad-based training, work organisation models
that promote learning, and comprehensive continuing
professional development that fosters autonomous

work and is designed as an active instrument for promoting
systematic staff development and career advancement.<br><br>
In Industrie 4.0, technological development
goals and work organisation models should be established
and configured together in accordance with the
specific economic and social circumstances. It will be
necessary to enable more flexible manufacturing whilst
at the same time establishing clear boundaries between
employees’ work and private lives, enabling them to
achieve a realistic work-life balance.<br><br>
In this context, the innovation strategy being promoted
by the trade unions under the banner of “better, not
cheaper” could point the way towards robust standards
and pathways for creating good and fair jobs and

a secure future for manufacturing sites and their employees.
The strategy incorporates a labour-oriented
organisational design with enhanced participation
rights, co-determination and training opportunities.<br><br>
Nonetheless, it is still capable of meeting the demands
of global competitiveness and the need for greater flexibility.<br><br>
The “better, not cheaper”8 strategy targets technology
leadership as the basis for securing the future of
German industry. Consequently, good jobs, technological
innovation and worker co-determination are not
mutually exclusive in the context of the Industrie 4.0 initiative.
Rather, they form part of a forward-looking approach
to the search for technologically efficient solutions
that are also socially sustainable.<br><br>


Recommended actions
--  The Industrie 4.0<br><br> Platform should continue to study the issue of “People and Work in Industrie 4.0”
through an interdisciplinary expert working group. The working group’s remit should comprise three
main goals:<br><br>
1. To ascertain and document the impact on work and employment (opportunities and risks) together with
the actions required to achieve employee-oriented labour and training policies<br><br>
2. To provide guidelines and practical aids for developing and implementing the socio-technical approach,
together with the relevant reference projects<br><br>
3. To promote innovative approaches to participative work organisation and lifelong learning that embrace
the entire workforce, irrespective of age, gender or qualifications<br><br>
--  The Platform should set up a regular dialogue between the social partners to enable transparent
identification and discussion of the key advances, problems and potential solutions associated with the
implementation of Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
--  The Platform should arrange effective knowledge transfer between stakeholders inside and outside of
companies at both national and international levels. In addition to innovative knowledge management, this
will also require the establishment of broad-based social networks.<br><br>

5.6 Training and continuing professional
development for Industrie 4.0<br><br>
As described above, the implementation of Industrie
4.0 should result in a labour-oriented socio-technical
factory and labour system. This will in turn pose new
challenges for vocational and academic training and
continuing professional development (CPD). These
challenges include the need to expand provision for
the developers of manufacturing engineering components
and their users.<br><br>
It is likely that Industrie 4.0 will significantly transform
job and skills profiles as a result of two trends. Firstly,
traditional manufacturing processes characterised by
a very clear division of labour will now be embedded
in a new organisational and operational structure
where they will be supplemented by decision-taking,
coordination, control and support service functions.
Secondly, it will be necessary to organise and coordinate
the interactions between virtual and real machines,
plant control systems and production management
systems.<br><br>
Effectively, what this means is that the convergence
of ICT, manufacturing and automation technology
and software will result in many tasks now being performed
as part of a much broader technological, organisational
and social context.<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 will also require fundamental changes to
the way IT experts are trained. The ability to identify
application requirements in different industries and
recruit development partners from around the world
will increasingly take precedence over purely technological
expertise. The extremely wide range of potential
applications means that there is a limit to what can
be achieved through standardised training programmes.<br><br>
It will become more and more important to
engage in a dialogue with manufacturing industry in
order to ensure that the requirements of the digital
economy are reflected in training provision. As such,
training partnerships between businesses and higher
education institutions will be even more important in
the future than they are today. Short basic training
programmes will need to be followed by work placements
and advanced study courses. It will be important
to open up access to science and engineering

studies and place greater emphasis on transferable
skills such as business or project management. It is
businesses and their customers who should drive the
changes made to the academic training of IT experts.
In keeping with the principles underpinning Industrie
4.0, this will also involve close convergence of IT and
production engineering training. The relevant learning
content for Industrie 4.0 will thus need to be identified
and the appropriate didactic and methodological approaches
will need to be developed. It is possible that
in particular some of the creative areas of businesses
such as interdisciplinary product and process development
could require completely new qualifications.<br><br>
These would form part of a dual strategy that would
enable companies to respond to the challenges of a
shrinking labour market and high market volatility.
In this context, it will be key to develop professional adult
education provision (teaching methods, career profile).<br><br>
Skills assessments9 should be used to improve mobility
between vocational and academic education and between
the different training and CPD programmes and
systems, as well as to improve recognition of skills that
are still relevant in the workplace despite not being connected
to an employee’s specialist area. There is a growing
need for people to have a grasp of the overall context
and to understand the interactions between all the actors
involved in the manufacturing process. Consequently,
in addition to increased demand for metacognitive
skills, social skills are also gaining in importance owing
to the growing significance of real-life and computerbased
interactions resulting from greater integration of
formerly demarcated departments and disciplines. In
technical terms, much greater emphasis will be placed
on interdisciplinary skills, an area where much work still
remains to be done.<br><br>
In order to ensure that individuals’ training potential can
be recognised and described transparently, it will be necessary
to develop standards for the recognition of nonformal
and informal education. The goal is to teach people
the principles of a new, holistic organisational model
and ensure that systems are described transparently so
that employees are confident in what they are doing.<br><br>

<a href= "link04.html">《人生七年》（56 Up）</a><br><br>


The Academy Cube<br><br>
The Academy Cube is an initiative that has been launched by German and international industrial enterprises
together with public institutions in order to address the need for new training formats and content
arising from Industrie 4.0. Current provision specifically targets skilled workers from southern Europe, where
unemployment* rates are particularly high. The Academy Cube provides online information to interested
parties about how they might be able to use their skills and knowledge both in their home country and
abroad.<br><br>
The Academy Cube offers unemployed graduates in ICT and engineering the opportunity to obtain targeted
qualifications and helps put them directly in touch with industrial enterprises. This is achieved via a
cloud-based platform where companies and institutions provide e-learning courses and post specific job
vacancies. The platform helps job seekers to obtain the training they need to apply for specific vacancies,
whilst also issuing them with the corresponding certificates. These certificates, that are based on standard
curricula, ensure that potential employers can be confident about the standard of the training and provide
transparency with regard to its content. The best candidates are automatically directed to the top job vacancies
of the participating companies.<br><br>
The Academy Cube concept was developed during the BMBF- and SAP AG-chaired Working Group 6 on
Education and Research for the Digital Society at the National IT Summit and was officially launched at
CeBIT 2013. Since March 2013, the programme has been offering six full curricula and twelve specific
courses in the area of Industrie 4.0. Learning content includes fields such as automation, big data analysis,
manufacturing and logistics processes and security and data protection.<br><br>
More information is available at: www.academy-cube.com<br><br>

<a href= "pic18.html">Figure 12: Networking different actors though the Academy Cube</a><br><br>
Whilst all the different levels of the training system are
affected, special priority should be attached to the expansion
of CPD. In particular, CPD in the workplace
should address the importance of health, physical activity
and lifestyle in ensuring a lengthy working life.<br><br>
By organising work in a way that fosters learning and
implementing appropriate training strategies, it should
be possible to achieve a human-centric approach to
manufacturing that takes account of differences in employees’
education, experience and skills sets in a way
that strengthens the innovative capacity of both individuals
and businesses. The organisation of work in a
way that fosters learning is also a key requirement for
lifelong learning. In view of the rapid technological
changes expected as a result of the introduction of
CPS-based systems, it should therefore also be one of
the goals of the smart factory. The comparative effectiveness of in-house versus out-of-house learning and
general versus vocational education should be the subject
of further research.<br><br>
In addition, Industrie 4.0 jobs will be designed to use
technologies such as CPS in order to enhance communication
between employees and integrate job support,
learning tasks and physical training in the workplace
into the standard working day at suitable intervals.
This will require employees’ workload to be monitored
on an ongoing basis.<br><br>
Job design should also take into account the different
roles performed by employees (from unskilled and
skilled workers or employees with advanced vocational
and technical qualifications to staff members with academic
qualifications such as bachelor’s and master’s
degrees or qualified engineers) as well as differences
in their circumstances such as age, education, experience
or cultural background.
<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>

Recommended actions<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group recommends the following measures with regard to qualifications, training
and CPD in the context of Industrie 4.0:<br><br>
1. Promotion of model projects<br><br>
Projects should incorporate actions that can be used to develop training and CPD strategies. These should
include strategies to promote mobility between vocational and academic training and between different
training and CPD courses and systems as well as to recognise additional skills that employees possess
outside their specific area of expertise.<br><br>
2. Establishment and promotion of “best practice networks”<br><br>
In order to guarantee knowledge transfer and sustainability, training and CPD “best practice networks”
should be established by competitive tender. These networks would be charged with developing and
documenting case studies, networking the various actors and supporting knowledge transfer.<br><br>
3. Investigation of new approaches to knowledge and skills acquisition in the workplace, development
of digital learning techniques<br><br>
Digital media and innovative learning technologies (e-learning) will play a prominent role in knowledge
transfer and skills development. In view of technological and demographic change and the fact that different
learners have different requirements, it will be necessary to develop new teaching methods and learning
assistance systems.<br><br>
4. Promotion of cross-cutting approaches to work organisation<br><br>
All Industrie 4.0 qualification, training and CPD measures will need to be accompanied by comprehensive
research in the shape of research and implementation partnerships. It will be of fundamental importance to investigate issues relating to work organisation, process design,
management and cooperation, together with their impact on the evolution of work and training in Industrie
4.0. This should also include the issue of how older workers can retain their employability against a backdrop
of increased life expectancy. In order to organise work in a way that fosters learning, it will be necessary
to develop the appropriate training strategies, analysis methods and management models. Overall, this
will present a number of significant challenges for training and CPD, including the need for comprehensive
continuing professional development provision and changes to at least some parts of the training system.<br><br>
5. Promotion of Industrie 4.0-specific learning content and interdisciplinary cooperation<br><br>
It will be necessary to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between all disciplines (e.g. manufacturing
engineering, automation engineering and IT) to deliver a systems engineering approach. This will require the
different disciplines to acquire a mutual understanding of each other’s positions and approaches and to
adopt an integrated view of strategy, business processes and systems. Interdisciplinary research will also be
necessary at the interface between technology and the law. Legal experts should be involved from the early
stages of the R&D process. By the same token, engineers will increasingly need to acquire a basic understanding
of the legal issues so that they can engage in a full dialogue with their legal counterparts.<br><br>
6. IT-based modelling of technological systems<br><br>
This includes modelling of the interaction between the real and digital worlds, including the appropriate formal
descriptions, as well as methodological aspects such as modelled mechatronic engineering or contemplating
the development of adaptations to existing systems (delta engineering) as opposed to developing completely
new systems from scratch.<br><br>

5.7 Regulatory framework<br><br>
Just like any other fundamental technological innovation,
the new manufacturing processes associated with
Industrie 4.0 will find themselves confronted with the
existing regulatory framework, a situation that raises
two interconnected challenges. On the one hand, uncertainty
regarding the legality of a new technology or
the associated liability and data protection issues could
inhibit its acceptance and slow down the innovation
process. Conversely, the de facto power of new technologies
and business models can be so great that it
becomes almost impossible to enforce existing legislation.
Consequently, short technological innovation cycles
and the disruptive nature of new technologies can
result in the danger of a chronic “enforcement deficit”
whereby current regulation fails to keep pace with technological
change.<br><br>
While Industrie 4.0 does not, on the whole, tread completely
uncharted regulatory territory, it does significantly
increase the complexity of the relevant regulatory issues. Two things are required to reconcile regulation
and technology: the formulation of criteria to ensure
that the new technologies comply with the law and development
of the regulatory framework in a way that
facilitates innovation. In the context of Industrie 4.0, it
will often be possible to achieve this through common
law contracts. Both factors require the regulatory analysis
of new technologies to begin as early as possible
during the R&D phase rather than being left until they
are already in use.<br><br>
Challenges<br><br>
1. Protecting corporate data<br><br>
As the Internet of Things becomes established in
smart factories, both the volume and the level of detail
of the corporate data generated will increase. Moreover,
business models will no longer involve just one
company, but will instead comprise highly dynamic
networks of companies and completely new value chains, as demonstrated by the RAN Project10, for example.<br><br>
Data will be generated and transmitted autonomously
by smart machines and these data will inevitably
cross company boundaries. A number of specific
dangers are associated with this new context C for
example, data that were initially generated and exchanged
in order to coordinate manufacturing and logistics
activities between different companies could, if
read in conjunction with other data, suddenly provide
third parties with highly sensitive information about
one of the partner companies that might, for example,
give them an insight into its business strategies. New
instruments will be required if companies wish to pursue
the conventional strategy of keeping such knowledge
secret in order to protect their competitive advantage.<br><br>
New, regulated business models will also be
necessary C the raw data that are generated may contain
information that is valuable to third parties and
companies may therefore wish to make a charge for
sharing them. Innovative business models like this will
also require legal safeguards (predominantly in the
shape of contracts) in order to ensure that the valueadded
created is shared out fairly, e.g. through the
use of dynamic pricing models.<br><br>
Current regulation of the protection of corporate data
only addresses some aspects of these dangers and
generally requires the data to be classified as business
or trade secrets. Furthermore, it usually only applies to
cases of illegal disclosure. As a rule, confidential information
that has been acquired legally, e.g. with the permission
of its owner, may subsequently be used for
other purposes. However, self-regulation such as confidentiality
agreements should make it possible to close
these legal loopholes. Contract law offers a means of
achieving highly specific regulation of a variety of different
scenarios. This will require the sensitivity of the data
and the degree of protection needed to be determined
on a case-by-case basis C under certain circumstances,
individual data protection law principles could provide
a model in this regard.<br><br>
However, contracts do have their limitations when it
comes to managing large volumes of voluntary legal arrangements,
since a disproportionately large amount of
work is involved in calculating the risks and negotiating
separate contracts for each individual case. It is therefore necessary to develop new contractual models that
allow businesses to retain sovereignty over “their” data
whilst still facilitating entrepreneurial flexibility.<br><br>
2. Liability<br><br>
When sensitive data are exchanged between different
companies, there is a risk that they may be used and/or
disclosed illicitly, or that they may be hacked by third
parties if, for example, the recipient fails to implement
adequate IT security measures. One solution to this
problem is provided by a type of contractual clause already
in widespread use that sets out the requisite
technical and organisational arrangements and any additional
measures (e.g. the duty to provide notification
of any security problems or breaches) and stipulates
penalties in the event of non-compliance. However, in
Industrie 4.0 manufacturing facilities are responsible
for a wider range of matters than in the past. They may
now be subject to a liability action not only if they fail to
meet their primary responsibilities (in terms of the product’s
durability, correct operation and appearance), but
also for failings in their role as part of a network of smart
objects.<br><br>
In these scenarios, the issue of liability and responsibility
becomes even more important C when autonomous
systems are deployed in networks, a lack of structural
transparency could make it almost impossible to explicitly
determine who performed a particular action, resulting
in uncertainty with regard to legal liability. It is true
that businesses employing manufacturing systems that
use autonomous data processing are legally liable for
the security of their manufacturing facilities and products
vis-à-vis third parties. Current tort and product liability
law already provides adequate solutions in this
area. However, if the other partners in a network wish to
avoid being held jointly liable, or if they want at least to
have recourse against the other partners, then it is essential
for their responsibilities to be contractually stipulated
from the outset and/or for actions to be clearly
attributed to the owners of the respective systems. This
also has implications for the insurability of residual risk
and the way that the insurance industry calculates the
relevant premiums.<br><br>
Correct attribution of liability will be facilitated by the provision
of precise documentary evidence concerning the different manufacturing steps and system statuses (although
highly detailed protocol data relating to specific
individuals could cause data protection law problems).
Consequently, technology-based documentation procedures
such as personal or device-based digital signatures
will play a far more important role in Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
3. Handling personal data<br><br>
As the interaction between employees and CPS increases,
so will the volume and level of detail of the
personal data held for individual employees. This is especially
true of assistance systems that record information
about an employee’s location, their vital signs or
the quality of their work. This issue could pose a threat
to employees’ right to informational self-determination.
Scenarios with an international dimension are particularly
problematic in this regard. German data protection
law places strict restrictions on the outsourcing of the
analysis of data captured in smart factories to companies
located outside the European Union (EU) or European
Economic Area (EEA) (including companies belonging
to the same group) or the disclosure outside
Europe of corporate data containing personal information
about employees. This restriction is particularly applicable
if data protection standards in the country receiving
the data are lower than those found in Europe.
This could result in problematic constraints for globally
networked value chains.<br><br>
Current regulation fails to adequately address these
problems. Outsourced data processing models are already
encountering difficulties (e.g. in the realm of
cloud computing), since local data protection standards
are generally not applicable in countries outside of
Europe, meaning that in practice it is impossible for client
companies to comply with their data protection responsibilities.<br><br>
Businesses therefore have a growing need for a legally
unambiguous and practical solution for handling personal
data. It may be possible, up to a point, to achieve
this through in-house binding corporate rules, collective
agreements and company agreements, although it any circumstances undercut existing data protection
standards. In any event, these instruments would need
to be adapted to take account of the specific characteristics
of Industrie 4.0.<br><br>
The data protection law requirements for custom product
features will depend on the product and application
in question. One issue that is especially relevant to Industrie
4.0, for example, is the incorporation of data processing
components into the end product. Whilst these
components may initially be used during the manufacturing
process, they may eventually come into the possession
of end customers who use them for purposes
for which they were not originally intended. In order to
prevent this from happening and restrict the kind of data
processing that the built-in components can be used
for, their capabilities should be confined to what is
strictly necessary as defined by data protection law.<br><br>
4. Trade restrictions<br><br>
As more and more complex systems are deployed in
Industrie 4.0, it becomes increasingly likely that individual
components may be subject to national and international
trade restrictions. Encryption technologies
are both necessary and desired by customers in order
to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of CPS communication.
However, in many emerging markets, such
as China, the use, sale, importing and exporting of encryption
products are only permitted under licence. In
the EU, on the other hand, shipment of encryption
technologies is allowed within Europe and to certain
other countries such as Japan, Canada and the US,
but they are classed as dual use goods11 and subject
to export restrictions for many other destinations.<br><br>
Even today, companies wishing to have a global presence
in tomorrow’s key markets are to some extent
already finding themselves forced to operate in legal
grey areas if cryptographic components are built into
larger manufacturing facilities. This legal uncertainty
will only increase in Industrie 4.0 and could become a
significant barrier to trade.<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">德国的工业4.0</a><br><br>

Recommended actions<br><br>
The regulatory challenges described above are not trivial and it will be essential to find solutions to them if the
Industrie 4.0 initiative is to succeed. For the most part, these “solutions” will not entail legislation, but will instead
require a mix of instruments comprising regulatory, technical and policy elements. Moreover, it will be
important to raise awareness of the problems outlined above among SMEs by engaging professional associations
and government ministries to act as multipliers.<br><br>
One aspect that will be especially important for SMEs is the development of practical guidelines, checklists
and model contract clauses. New contract models need to guarantee protection of business and trade secrets
on the one hand, whilst also ensuring that any value-added generated through the new business models is
shared out fairly. It will therefore be necessary to define the roles of the various partners as precisely as possible
(including new roles such as different types of information broker).<br><br>
As far as liability is concerned, the support provided should focus on data security and the requirement to
provide documentary evidence, particularly at critical points where items are handed over from one partner to
another. As for employee data protection, best practice models containing sample company agreements
should be developed in order to ensure that the requirements of Industrie 4.0 do not encroach upon employees’
data protection rights. With regard to the secure and confidential handling of sensitive corporate data
belonging to third parties, it would be desirable to engage in efforts to promote self-regulation through measures
such as audits or certification of compliance with IT security standards. Nonetheless, it will still be necessary
to legislate on certain issues. These include outsourcing of data processing activities, although it is at EU
level that the need for legislation in this area currently exists.<br><br>
There is also an urgent need for harmonisation in the field of trade restrictions, especially with regard to encryption
products. In order to ensure that Germany can successfully sustain a position as a leading supplier
for Industrie 4.0, efforts should be undertaken in the medium to long term to promote common international
regulations, for example through the World Trade Organization.<br><br>
In more general terms, the challenges posed by Industrie 4.0 in the areas where technology comes into
contact with regulation will require interdisciplinary research. It will be important to ensure that legal experts
are involved right from the earliest stages of the R&D process. By the same token, engineers will increasingly
need to acquire a basic understanding of the legal issues so that they can engage in a full dialogue
with their legal counterparts. A partnership along these lines between engineers and legal experts could
provide Germany with a genuine competitive advantage in the Industrie 4.0 market. As such, it will be necessary
for the Industrie 4.0 Platform to ensure that legal experts are involved in the various working groups
from an early stage.<br><br>



5.8 Resource efficiency<br><br>
The nature of manufacturing industry means that it is by
far the largest consumer of raw materials in industrialised
nations. Together with the private sector, it is also the
principal consumer of primary energy and electricity. In
addition to the high costs involved, this situation entails
risks to the environment and security of supply which
need to be minimised by regulation. Consequently, industry
is undertaking major efforts to reduce its consumption
of energy and resources or find alternative
sources. However, these efforts will need to be sustained
over many years if they are to have any chance of
succeeding. Ultimately, this will involve changes in manufacturing
processes and the design of machinery and
plant, since these are the only areas where material and
energy consumption can really be influenced.<br><br>
The starting point is the amount of resources that are
used by manufacturing companies, both within the company
itself and throughout the rest of the value network.<br><br>
It is possible to draw a distinction between three categories
of resources and how they are used:<br><br>
1. Raw materials, additives, operating supplies and all
the different kinds of energy carriers, including conversion
from one type of energy into another<br><br>
2. Human resources, i.e. human labour<br><br>
3. Financial resources, i.e. the necessary investment
and operating costs<br><br>
In terms of how these resources are used, it is possible
to focus on maximising the output achieved with a given
quantity of resources, or on using the lowest possible
quantity of resources to achieve a given output. In the
first scenario, the emphasis is on calculating resource
productivity, whilst in the second scenario the focus is
on calculating resource efficiency. A range of metrics
are now available to perform these measurements (Life
Cycle Assessments, carbon footprinting12, etc).<br><br>


Challenges<br><br>
In general terms, Industrie 4.0 will need to investigate
and implement ways of reducing the resources consumed
during industrial manufacturing processes as a
whole and by the machinery and equipment used during
production. The outcomes of the joint Federal Ministry
of Education and Research (BMBF) and German
Engineering Federation (VDMA) “Efficiency Factory”
(Effizienzfabrik)13 initiative could serve as a model in
this regard. When implementing efficient manufacturing
processes it is important to consider not only basic
functions but also the stability of the processes under
dynamic conditions, such as frequent stopping and
starting and prevention of faulty products (which are a
waste of materials and energy).<br><br>
It is therefore necessary to consider productivity in
terms of preventing unstable processes that result in
quality issues which in turn require the product to be
repaired or completely remade. Availability also needs
to be considered. Manufacturing equipment can break
down (so it is important to build in redundancies to
minimise the risk of failure), resources may not be readily
available when needed and inventory levels may not
be in line with requirements (semi-finished and finished
goods).<br><br>
One of the key challenges for Industrie 4.0 will be to
demonstrate that the additional resources invested in
the deployment of CPS and the associated infrastructure
can generate sufficient opportunities to deliver resource
productivity and efficiency gains based on the
total amount of resources used during engineering,
manufacturing, production control, intralogistics, procurement
and distribution logistics.<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 provides the opportunity to optimise delivery
of the overarching goals of resource productivity
and efficiency on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Recommended actions<br><br>
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group recommends that a Working Group should be established through the Industrie
4.0 Platform to deal exclusively with the topic of resource productivity and efficiency. The Working
Group’s remit should include the following tasks:<br><br>
--  Adoption and development of the outcomes of the BMBF/VDMA “Efficiency Factory” initiative.<br><br>
--  Demonstration of resource savings in terms of enhanced resource productivity and efficiency in the
manufacturing environment based on the avoidance of substitution processes resulting from productivity
or availability issues.<br><br>
--  Calculation and assessment of trade-offs between the additional resources required to deploy CPS and
their associated infrastructure and the potential savings generated. This should also be done for the
different categories of resources when it comes to taking decisions on modernising production lines or
building new ones and the type of automation equipment required. These assessments should take
account of the industry or sector in question and whether the value network is regional or global in scope.<br><br>
--  It will be necessary to take account of the various metrics and KPIs (key performance indicators) that are
being used to assess resource productivity and efficiency and eco-friendliness in current projects and
initiatives. The development of decision-supporting KPIs such as the Green Production Index should also
be taken into account, together with the basic data required to take transparent, resource-oriented
investment decisions, particularly in the area of industrial automation.

6 How does Germany compare with the rest of the world?<br><br>

Germany is not the only country to have identified the
trend towards using the Internet of Things in manufacturing
(Industrial Internet1) and its disruptive impact on industrial
processes as strategic challenges for manufacturing
industry going forward. However, a variety of
different terms are used around the world to describe
the phenomenon of Industrie 4.0. Especially in the English-
speaking world and at EU level, it is customary to
refer to the Internet of Things and the trend towards
digitalisation in terms of a third Industrial Revolution. This
number is arrived at either by including the second Industrial
Revolution (the establishment of mechanical
mass production) as part of the first,2 or not counting the
third transformation of industry resulting from the automation
of manufacturing processes as a genuine revolution
in its own right.3, 4<br><br>
The terms “Smart Production”, “Smart Manufacturing”
or “Smart Factory” are used in Europe, China and the
US5 to refer specifically to digital networking of production


to create smart manufacturing systems, whereas
the equally fashionable term “Advanced Manufacturing”
embraces a broader spectrum of modernisation
trends in the manufacturing environment.6<br><br>
As far as the global markets for machinery and plant
manufacturing, electrical engineering, automation and
ICT are concerned, the examples of selected countries
serve to illustrate different policy responses to these
trends.<br><br>
International market trends<br><br>
Following a period of spectacular growth between
2004 and 2008, when output rose by approximately
38 percent, the global financial crisis triggered a dramatic
slump in orders and production among Germany’s
machinery and plant manufacturers. However,
business started to pick up again as early as the middle
of 2009 as companies strove to make up the ground
lost during the crisis. Demand has now returned to normal,
with two percent growth forecast for 2013.<br><br>

<a href= "pic19.html">Figure 13: Mechanical engineering industry sales in selected countries</a><br><br>
According to a recent survey by the German Engineering
Federation (VDMA), the majority of German mechanical
engineering firms still see themselves as
among the world’s leaders and regard their main competitors
as domestic ones, followed only distantly by
competitors from the US and Italy. Global sales in the
mechanical engineering sector came to around 2.1 trillion
euros in 2011. A glance at the position of the mechanical
engineering industry in selected countries reveals
an extremely heterogeneous picture. (see also
Fig. 13).<br><br>
Since 2002, large-scale transfers of production to
other parts of the world have resulted in a sharp increase
in the US mechanical engineering sector’s dependency
on imports. The number of people employed
in the industry fell by 25 percent between 2002 and
2010.8 However, there have been some signs of a
gradual recovery since 2010, with rises in both domestic
and export demand. The press in the US has been quick to seize on terms such as “reshoring”9 and
“insourcing boom”10 to describe what it already perceives
as a fundamental sea change.<br><br>
China is also devoting a huge amount of effort to catching
up with other countries in terms of its mechanical
engineering technology and strengthening its market position.
Over the past five years, it has risen to become the
world’s largest machinery manufacturer, with sales of
563 billion euros in 2011. At the same time, China has
also redoubled its efforts on the exports front. In 2011,
the Chinese investment goods industry exported goods
worth 87.7 billion euros, an increase of more than 20
percent compared to the previous year. It thus leapt forward
to become the world’s fourth largest exporter of
machinery, with a 10.2 percent share of the market.<br><br>
There has been a pronounced rise in Russia’s demand
for machinery and plant since 2010. Russia, which is
the official partner country of this year’s Hannover
trade fair, is already the fourth largest export market for German mechanical engineering firms, behind China,
the US and France. Germany is also Russia’s
number one machinery supplier, with a 22.6 percent
market share. The Russian government is forecasting
continued growth of the Russian market over the next
few years and is supporting this growth through a
funding programme worth billions of euros. In the
longer term, there is significant potential for German
machinery and plant manufacturers to export Industrie
4.0 products to Russia.<br><br>
In 2011, the global electrical engineering market was
worth 3,414 billion euros. At 116 billion euros, the German
electrical engineering market is the fifth largest
in the world, after China (1,119 billion euros), the US
(486 billion euros), Japan (284 billion euros) and South
Korea (155 billion euros). In recent years, the growth of
the global electrical engineering market has largely
been due to newly-industrialised countries whose total
market volume of 1.7 trillion euros reached the same
level as that of the industrialised nations for the first time
in 2011. It is expected that growth will remain significantly
higher in the newly-industrialised countries than
in the industrialised nations during 2012 and 2013.<br><br>
The global automation market recently reached 350
billion euros, meaning that it now accounts for more
than one tenth of the global electrical engineering market.<br><br>
In the past few years, China has risen to become
the single largest regional market. Its market is currently
worth 100 billion euros, giving it a 29 percent share
of the global market and meaning that it has now overtaken
Europe, where the market is worth just 93 billion
euros. Trailing some way behind these two markets are
the US (12 percent or 40 billion euros) and Japan (8
percent or 26 billion euros). At 21 billion euros (6 percent),
Germany is the world’s fourth largest market.<br><br>
China’s lead is even greater when it comes to automation
product manufacturing. China accounts for 30
percent of global production, or 103 billion euros out of
a total of 350 billion euros. The US and Japan are more
or less tied for second place with roughly eleven percent
each, closely followed by Germany, with ten percent.<br><br>
However, Germany is the world’s largest exporter
of automation products and systems (29 billion euros),
followed by China (27 billion euros) and the US (21
billion euros). <br><br>

The global turnover of the ICT industry is forecast to
rise by 4.6 percent this year to 2.69 trillion euros. At 5.2
and 4.2 percent respectively, the two key segments of
information technology and telecommunications are
both experiencing strong growth. However, there are
significant disparities in market trends across different
regions. Whilst the industry is booming in newly-industrialised
countries, throughout most of Western Europe
it is either flat or in decline. Between them, China, India
and Russia already account for one seventh (14 percent)
of global ICT demand this year. The Chinese market
alone is forecast to grow by 6.6 percent to 235
billion euros in 2013, overtaking Japan (221 billion euros)
as the world’s second largest ICT market. The US
market remains the undisputed leader in terms of demand
for ICT. The latest figures put its total value at
725 billion euros, an increase of 5.8 percent. Growth in
western Europe has been more sluggish than in the
rest of the world. In 2013, ICT sales are expected to
rise by a modest 1.3 percent to 625 billion euros. The
German information technology market, on the other
hand, is forecast to grow by 3.0 percent in 2013 to 75
billion euros. Germany’s software market is also set to
experience strong growth, rising by 5.1 percent to 17.8
billion euros. The market for IT services such as outsourcing
and maintenance is forecast to grow by 3.0
percent to 35.9 billion euros, whilst the hardware market
is expected to return a modest growth figure of 1.2
percent.<br><br>
With SAP, Software AG and Telekom, together with
major subsidiaries of US (e.g. IBM and HP) and Asian
companies, Germany has a globally significant level of
IT competencies clustered closely together. This provides
a new opportunity for Germany to take a leading
role in Industrie 4.0.<br><br>

During the course of our
work together it has become
apparent that Germany possesses
all the necessary
competencies in the fields of
manufacturing technology
and mechanical engineering
to continue to enjoy global
success in tomorrow’s world

Services  <br><br>

Industrial policy funding initiatives in selected countries
Other countries are also supporting the modernisation
of manufacturing industry through funding programmes
and research initiatives. However, the available information
suggests that in the US and China, for example,
the transformation envisaged by the Industrie 4.0 initiative
is regarded as no more than one trend among
many, for example the introduction of new materials
and technologies.11<br><br>

The US administration has once again started to attach
greater priority to the mechanical engineering sector.<br><br>
12 It is now seeking to pursue an active industrial
policy in order to create jobs and encourage reshoring
of manufacturing to the US. In the summer of 2011,
President Obama launched the Advanced Manufacturing
Partnership (AMP), a private-sector led body that
brings together representatives of the research, business
and political communities to chart a “course for
investing and furthering the development of the emerging
technologies”. The AMP Steering Committee is
made up of the Presidents of the top engineering universities
(MIT, UC Berkeley, Stanford, CMU, Michigan
and GIT) and the CEOs of leading US enterprises (including
Caterpillar, Corning, Dow Chemical, Ford, Honeywell,
Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Northrop Grumman,
Procter & Gamble and United Technologies).<br><br>
In July 2012, the AMP submitted a report detailing 16
recommendations13 which include the establishment of a
National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes
(NNMII). These institutes, which take the form of Public-
Private Partnerships, are intended to act as “regional
hubs for manufacturing excellence” in order to improve
the global competitiveness of US businesses and increase
investment in US manufacturing facilities. 14<br><br>
In addition, the Obama administration is making more
R&D funding available for manufacturing research. In
the 2013 budget, the funding earmarked for advanced
manufacturing is being increased by 19 percent to 2.2
billion dollars. On top of this, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), which is the body
responsible for standardisation, has been allocated
100 million dollars of funding to provide technical support
to domestic manufacturing industry through the
provision of research facilities and know-how. NIST is
also responsible for the Advanced Manufacturing Portal15
which was set up at the AMP’s recommendation
and is intended to facilitate networking between government,
university and private initiatives in this field.<br><br>
Finally, the US administration’s Jobs and Innovation Accelerator
Challenge initiative is investing 20 million dollars
in a further ten Public-Private Partnerships in the
field of advanced manufacturing.<br><br>

CPS and the Internet of Things (IOT) have already
been benefiting from public funding in the US for several
years. Indeed, Cyber-Physical Systems were identified
as a key research area by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) as long ago as 2006. However, very
little is actually being done with regard to the specific
use of CPS in manufacturing.16 The Networking and Information
Technology Research and Development (NITRD)
Programme brings together 18 research agencies
in order to coordinate research in different IT
domains including Human-Computer Interaction and
Information Management. In 2011, the NITRD had a
budget of over 3 billion dollars at its disposal.<br><br>
China<br><br>
China is also striving to expand its mechanical engineering
industry. The 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015)
sets out the aim of reducing dependency on foreign
technology and pursuing global technology leadership
in seven “strategic industries” including High-End
Equipment Manufacturing and a New-Generation Information
Technology17. China’s leaders are making a total
of 1.2 trillion euros available for this goal up to 2015
and are stimulating supply and demand through subsidies,
tax breaks and other financial incentives. They
also intend to increase R&D investment as a proportion
of GDP from 1.5 to 2 percent by 2015.18 In the machine
tools sector, one of the priorities is the development
of “intelligent manufacturing equipment”, “intelligent
control systems” and “high-class numerically
controlled machines”, whilst the priorities in the area of
IT include the Internet of Things and its applications,
including “industrial control and automation”.<br><br>
Since 2010, the priority attached by Beijing to the Internet
of Things has grown significantly.19 China has
held an annual Internet of Things Conference since
2010 and China’s first IoT Center was opened during
the first of these conferences. This research centre has
received 117 million US dollars worth of funding to investigate
basic IoT technologies and the associated
standardisation requirements. In addition, the School of
Software at Dalian University of Technology established

a research group as long ago as 2009 with a remit that
includes the investigation of CPS applications in automation
engineering. 20 China has also established an
“IoT innovation zone” in the city of Wuxi in Jiangsu Province
with 300 companies employing more than 70,000
people. China’s leaders are planning to invest a total of
800 million US dollars in the IoT industry between now
and 2015.21<br><br>
EU<br><br>
At EU level, research into the Internet of Things is currently
benefiting from increased support through the
Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007-
2013). The largest budgetary allocation of in excess of
9 billion euros is earmarked for the ICT funding priority.
Within the programme, there are a variety of cross-border
initiatives geared towards implementing the Internet
of Things in manufacturing industry. The Siemens-
led “IoT@Work” project has been given a budget
of 5.8 million euros to develop the Plug&Work concept
in a practical setting. Meanwhile, a total of 2.4 billion
euros has been invested in the ARTEMIS technology
platform to promote R&D projects in eight sub-programmes
that include both “Manufacturing and Production
Automation” and CPS.22 In addition, 1.2 billion
euros have been awarded to the Public-Private Partnership
initiative “Factories of the Future” which launches
annual calls for proposals for projects in the area of
smart, ICT-driven manufacturing. Under the auspices of
this initiative, the SAP-led project “ActionPlanT” recently submitted its “Vision for Manufacturing 2.0”, that is
intended to serve as a discussion document for future
research funding initiatives under the Eighth Framework
Programme for Research C “Horizon 2020”
(2014-2020). Horizon 2020’s proposed budget of 80
billion euros will make it the world’s largest R&D funding
programme.23<br><br>
India<br><br>
Innovation funding is one of the core priorities of India’s
Five-Year Plan (2012-2017) which provides for an
increase in public and private R&D investment to two
percent of GDP.24 In 2011, the “Cyber-Physical Systems
Innovation Hub” project was launched under the
auspices of the Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology to conduct research into a variety of
areas, including humanoid robotics. Moreover, Bosch
founded the Centre for Research in CPS in Bangalore
in November 2011. Both the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft
and several top Indian research centres are participating
in this project in an advisory capacity. The partnership,
which is funded to the tune of 22.8 billion euros,
aims to create an optimal research and working environment
for the IT specialists of the future. In future,
support will also be provided to industry and the research
community, for example through research contracts.
25 Even today, according to a recent study by the
Zebra Tech Company, Indian businesses are world
leaders in terms of take-up and use of IoT technology.26<br><br>

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE<br><br>
Many of Germany’s competitors have also recognised the trend for using the Internet of Things in the
manufacturing environment and are promoting it through a range of institutional and financial measures. The
Industrie 4.0 Working Group believes that Germany is well placed to become a global pacesetter in the
area of Industrie 4.0. The Industrie 4.0 Platform should undertake regular critical appraisals of the extent to
which the measures implemented and planned by Germany are succeeding in delivering this goal.<br><br>
A separate research project should be established to carry out a more detailed analysis of Germany’s international
competitors and the markets it should be targeting over the next ten to 15 years.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Germany has the potential to become a leading market
and leading supplier for Industrie 4.0. If this is to be
achieved then, in addition to meeting the technological
challenges, it will be essential for the different industries
and their employees to work together in order to shape
developments. The Industrie 4.0 Platform constitutes a
crucial step towards ensuring that the innovation potential
of Industrie 4.0 is leveraged across all industries.
The journey towards implementing the Industrie 4.0 vision
will involve an evolutionary process that will progress
at different rates in individual companies and
sectors. Demonstration projects should therefore be
developed and new products brought to market as
soon as possible.<br><br>
Implementation should be addressed through a dual
strategy. Existing basic technologies and experience
will need to be adapted to the requirements of manufacturing
engineering and rolled out rapidly on a widespread basis. At the same time, it will also be necessary
to research and develop innovative solutions for
new manufacturing sites and new markets. If this is
done successfully, Germany will be in a position to become
a leading supplier for Industrie 4.0. Moreover, the
establishment of a leading market will serve to make
Germany a more attractive manufacturing location and
help preserve its domestic manufacturing industry.<br><br>
The Industry-Science Research Alliance launched the
strategic initiative Industrie 4.0 in early 2011. As of
April 2013, the industry’s professional associations
BITKOM, VDMA and ZVEI will be joining together with
actors from the business and research communities
and civil society in order to ensure that implementation
of the initiative is progressed in a coherent manner. A
systemic approach in which all the stakeholders are involved
in a mutual exchange of technological and social
innovations will provide a sound basis for successful
cooperation in this regard.<br><br>

The strategic initiative Industrie 4.0<br><br>
Industrie 4.0 is a “strategic initiative” of the German
government that was adopted as part of the High-Tech
Strategy 2020 Action Plan in November 2011. It was
launched in January 2011 by the COMMUNICATION
Promoters Group of the Industry-Science Research Alliance
(FU). Its initial implementation recommendations
were formulated by the Industrie 4.0 Working Group
between January and October 2012 under the coordination
of acatech CNational Academy of Science and
Engineering. The Working Group was chaired by Dr
Siegfried Dais, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Management
of Robert-Bosch GmbH, and Prof. Henning
Kagermann, President of acatech. The recommendations
were submitted as a report to the German government
at the Industry-Science Research Alliance’s Implementation
Forum held at the Produktionstechnisches
Zentrum Berlin on 2 October 2012. Going forward,
further implementation measures will be progressed
through a number of working groups under the Industrie
4.0 Platform which was recently established by the
industry’s professional associations BITKOM, VDMA
and ZVEI and which now has the support of its own
Secretariat.
<br><br>
Since 2006, the German government has been pursuing
a High-Tech Strategy geared towards interdepartmental
coordination of research and innovation initiatives
in Germany with the aim of securing Germany’s
strong competitive position through technological innovation.<br><br>
The current incarnation is known as the
High-Tech Strategy 2020 and focuses on five priority
areas: climate/energy, health/food, mobility, security
and communication. The strategy revolves around a
number of “strategic initiatives” through which the Industry-
Science Research Alliance is addressing concrete
medium-term scientific and technological development
goals over a period of ten to fifteen years. The
initiatives have formulated concrete innovation strategies
and implementation roadmaps designed to make
Germany a leader in supplying solutions to global
challenges.
This report presents and expands upon the recommendations
put forward by the Industrie 4.0 Working
Group in October 2012 and will provide a basis for
the work of the Industrie 4.0 Platform that will commence
in April 2013<br><br>


The Industrie 4.0 Platform<br><br>
The professional associations BITKOM, VDMA and
ZVEI have established the joint Industrie 4.0 Platform in
order to progress the initiative and ensure a coordinated,
cross-sectoral approach.<br><br>
The Platform’s central coordination and management
body is the industry-led Steering Committee. It is responsible
for setting the Platform’s strategic course,
appointing working groups and guiding their work. The
Steering Committee is supported by a Scientific Advisory
Committee that includes members from the manufacturing,
IT and automation industries as well as a
number of other disciplines. The Working Groups report
to the Steering Committee, but are free to determine
their own structure. They are open to all interested
parties.<br><br>
The Governing Board provides input with regard to
strategy and supports the Platform’s political activities.
Where necessary, it represents the Platform vis-à-vis
policymakers, the media and the public.<br><br>

The Secretariat is staffed by members of the three professional
associations and provides the Steering Committee
with organisational and administrative support. It
deals with knowledge transfer, internal relations and
relations with similar initiatives. It is also responsible for
media and public relations activities.<br><br>
